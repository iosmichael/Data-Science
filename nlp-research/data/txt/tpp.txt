respond in writing to any question posed by any other Party regarding the measure within 14 days of receipt of the question.

4. A Party which considers that another Party should have notified a measure under paragraph 2(a) may bring the matter to the attention of that other Party. If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved promptly thereafter, the Party which considers that the measure should have been notified may itself bring the measure to the attention of the other Parties. 5.

For the purposes of this Section, TRQs means only TRQs that are established under this Agreement as set out in a Party's Schedule to Annex 2-D (Tariff Commitments). For greater certainty, this Section shall not apply to TRQs set out in a Party's Schedule to the WTO Agreement. For greater certainty, this paragraph shall not apply to conditions, limits or eligibility requirements that apply regardless of whether or not the importer utilises the TRQ when importing the good.

eligibility requirement. Any Party with a demonstrable commercial interest in supplying the good may submit a written request for consultations to the Party seeking to introduce the new or additional condition, limit or eligibility requirement. On receipt of such a request for consultations, the Party seeking to introduce the new or additional condition, limit or eligibility requirement shall promptly undertake consultations with the Party that submitted the request, in accordance with Article 2.32.6 (Transparency). (c) The Party seeking to introduce the new or additional condition, limit or eligibility requirement may do so if: (i) it has consulted with any Party with a demonstrable commercial interest in supplying the good that has submitted a written request for consultations pursuant to subparagraph (b); and no Party with a demonstrable commercial interest in supplying the good that submitted a written request for consultations pursuant to subparagraph (b) objected, after the consultation, to the introduction of the new or additional condition, limit or eligibility requirement.

(ii)

(d)

A new or additional condition, limit or eligibility requirement that is the outcome of any consultation held pursuant to subparagraph (c), shall be circulated to the Parties prior to its implementation.

Article 2.30: Allocation18 1. In the event that access under a TRQ is subject to an allocation mechanism, each importing Party shall ensure that: (a) any person of a Party that fulfils the importing Party's eligibility requirements is able to apply and to be considered for a quota allocation under the TRQ; unless otherwise agreed, it does not allocate any portion of the quota to a producer group, condition access to an allocation on the purchase of domestic production or limit access to an allocation to processors;

(b)

(c)

each allocation is made in commercially viable shipping quantities and, to the maximum extent possible, in the amounts that importers request; an allocation for in-quota imports is applicable to any tariff lines subject to the TRQ and is valid throughout the TRQ year; if the aggregate TRQ quantity requested by applicants exceeds the quota size, allocation to eligible applicants shall be conducted by equitable and transparent methods; applicants have at least four weeks after the opening of the application period to submit their applications; and quota allocation takes place no later than four weeks before the opening of the quota period, unless the allocation is based in whole or in part on import performance during the 12-month period immediately preceding the quota period. If the Party bases the allocation in whole or in part on import performance during the 12month period immediately preceding the quota period, the Party shall make a provisional allocation of the full quota amount no later than four weeks before the opening of the quota period. All final allocation decisions, including any revisions, shall be made and communicated to applicants by the beginning of the quota period.

2. During the first TRQ year that this Agreement is in force for a Party, if less than 12 months remain in the TRQ year on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party, the Party shall make available to quota applicants, beginning on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party, the quota quantity established in its Schedule to Annex 2-D (Tariff Commitments), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be a whole number consisting of the number of months remaining in the TRQ year on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party, including the entirety of the month in which this Agreement enters into force for that Party, and the denominator of which shall be 12. The Party shall make the entire quota quantity established in its Schedule to Annex 2-D (Tariff Commitments) available to quota applicants beginning on the first day of each TRQ year thereafter that the quota is in operation. 3. The Party administering a TRQ shall not require the re-export of a good as a condition for application for, or utilisation of, a quota allocation. 4. Any quantity of goods imported under a TRQ under this Agreement shall not be counted towards, or reduce the quantity of, any other TRQ provided for

2-28

such goods in a Party's Schedule to the WTO Agreement or under any other trade agreements.19

Article 2.31: Return and Reallocation of TRQs 1. When a TRQ is administered by an allocation mechanism, a Party shall ensure that there is a mechanism for the return and reallocation of unused allocations in a timely and transparent manner that provides the greatest possible opportunity for the TRQ to be filled. 2. Each Party shall publish on a regular basis on its designated publicly available website all information concerning amounts allocated, amounts returned and, if available, quota utilisation rates. In addition, each Party shall publish on the same website amounts available for reallocation and the application deadline, at least two weeks prior to the date on which the Party will begin accepting applications for reallocations.

Article 2.32: Transparency 1. Each Party shall identify the entity or entities responsible for administering its TRQs and designate and notify at least one contact point, in accordance with Article 27.5 (Contact Points), to facilitate communications between the Parties on matters relating to the administration of its TRQs. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Parties of any amendments to the details of its contact point. 2. When a TRQ is administered by an allocation mechanism, the name and address of allocation holders shall be published on the designated publicly available website. 3. When a TRQ is administered on a first-come, first-served basis, over the course of each year, the importing Party's administering authority shall publish, in a timely and continually on-going manner on its designated publicly available website, utilisation rates and remaining available quantities for each TRQ. 4. When a TRQ of an importing Party that is administered on a first-come, first-served basis fills, that Party shall publish a notice to this effect on its designated publicly available website within 10 days.

19

For greater certainty, nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Party from applying a different in-quota rate of customs duty to goods from other Parties, as set out in that Party's Schedule to Annex 2-D (Tariff Commitments), than that applied to the same goods of non-Parties under a TRQ established under the WTO Agreement. Further, nothing in this paragraph requires a Party to change the in-quota quantity of any TRQ established under the WTO Agreement.

2-29

5. When a TRQ of an importing Party that is administered by an allocation mechanism fills, that Party shall publish a notice to this effect on its designated publicly available website as early as practicable. 6. On written request of an exporting Party or Parties, the Party administrating a TRQ shall consult with the requesting Party or Parties regarding the administration of its TRQ.

If an original Party does not notify an election under subparagraph (a) as provided for in subparagraph (c), that original Party shall, on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for the new Party, apply its Schedule to the new Party as provided for in

(d)

2-63

subparagraph (a)(ii). If a new Party does not notify an election under subparagraph (b) as provided for in subparagraph (c), the new Party shall, on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that new Party, apply its Schedule to that original Party as provided for in subparagraph (b)(ii). (e) For greater certainty: (i) an original Party that applies its Schedule to a new Party as provided for in subparagraph (a)(i) may unilaterally accelerate the elimination of customs duties on an originating good set out in its Schedule to this Annex with respect to the new Party in accordance with Article 2.4.5 (Elimination of Customs Duties); and a new Party that applies its Schedule to an original Party as provided for in subparagraph (b)(i) may unilaterally accelerate the elimination of customs duties on an originating good set out in its Schedule to this Annex with respect to the original Party in accordance with Article 2.4.5 (Elimination of Customs Duties).

(ii)

(f)

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if, on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for a new Party for which an original Party has elected to apply its Schedule as provided for in subparagraph (a)(i): (i) that original Party unilaterally accelerates the elimination of customs duties on an originating good of the new Party, that original Party shall not subsequently reverse that acceleration; and the new Party unilaterally accelerates the elimination of customs duties on an originating good of that original Party, the new Party shall not subsequently reverse that acceleration.

(ii)

5. In the event of a discrepancy in a Party's Schedule to this Annex between the staging category specified for an item and any tariff rate specified for that item for a particular year, that Party shall apply the rate required in accordance with the staging category specified for the item. 6. For the purposes of this Annex and a Party's Schedule: (a) year 1 means:

2-64

(i)

In addition, on request of the importing Party, the Party where the exporter or producer is located may, as it deems appropriate and in accordance with its laws and regulations, assist with the verification. This assistance may include providing a contact point for the verification, collecting information from the exporter or producer on behalf of the importing Party, or other activities in order that the importing Party may make a determination as to whether the good is originating.

If verifications of identical goods by a Party indicate a pattern of conduct by an importer, exporter or producer of false or unsupported representations relevant to a claim that a good imported into its territory qualifies as an originating good, the Party may withhold preferential tariff treatment to identical goods imported, exported or produced by that person until that person demonstrates that the identical goods qualify as originating. For the purposes of this paragraph, "identical goods" means goods that are the same in all respects relevant to the particular rule of origin that qualifies the goods as originating. 13. For the purpose of a verification request, it is sufficient for a Party to rely on the contact information of an exporter, producer or importer in a Party provided in a certification of origin.

If an invoice is issued in a nonParty, a Party shall require that the certification of origin be separate from the invoice.

Article 3.29: Refunds and Claims for Preferential Tariff Treatment after Importation 1. Each Party shall provide that an importer may apply for preferential tariff treatment and a refund of any excess duties paid for a good if the importer did not make a claim for preferential tariff treatment at the time of importation, provided that the good would have qualified for preferential tariff treatment when it was imported into the territory of the Party. 2.

Notwithstanding the textile and apparel product-specific rules of origin set out in Annex 4-A (Textiles and Apparel Product-Specific Rules of Origin), textile and apparel goods put up in sets for retail sale, classified as a result of the application of Rule 3 of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System, shall not be regarded as originating goods unless each of the goods in the set is an originating good or the total value of the non-originating goods in the set does not exceed 10 per cent of the value of the set. 6. For the purposes of paragraph 5: (a) the value of non-originating goods in the set shall be calculated in the same manner as the value of non-originating materials in Chapter 3 (Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures); and the value of the set shall be calculated in the same manner as the value of the good in Chapter 3 (Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures).

(b)

Treatment of Short Supply List Materials 7. Each Party shall provide that, for the purposes of determining whether a textile or apparel good is originating under Article 3.2(c) (Originating Goods), a material listed in Appendix 1 (Short Supply List of Products) to Annex 4-A
1

For greater certainty, this paragraph shall not be construed to require a material listed in Appendix 1 (Short Supply List of Products) to Annex 4-A (Textiles and Apparel Product-Specific Rules of Origin) to be produced from elastomeric yarns wholly formed in the territory of one or more of the Parties.
2

For the purposes of this paragraph, "wholly formed" means all production processes and finishing operations, beginning with the extrusion of filaments, strips, film or sheet, and including drawing to fully orient a filament or slitting a film or sheet into strip, or the spinning of all fibres into yarn, or both, and ending with a finished yarn or plied yarn.

4-2

(Textiles and Apparel Product-Specific Rules of Origin) is originating provided that the material meets any requirement, including any end use requirement, specified in the Appendix 1 (Short Supply List of Products) to Annex 4-A (Textiles and Apparel Product-Specific Rules of Origin). 8. If a claim that a textile or apparel good is originating relies on the incorporation of a material listed in Appendix 1 (Short Supply List of Products) to Annex 4-A (Textiles and Apparel Product-Specific Rules of Origin), the importing Party may require in the importation documentation, such as a certification of origin, the number or description of the material on Appendix 1 (Short Supply List of Products) to Annex 4-A (Textiles and Apparel ProductSpecific Rules of Origin). 9. Non-originating materials marked as temporary in Appendix 1 (Short Supply List of Products) to Annex 4-A (Textiles and Apparel Product-Specific Rules of Origin) may be considered as originating under paragraph 7 for five years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement. Treatment for Certain Handmade or Folkloric Goods 10. An importing Party may identify particular textile or apparel goods of an exporting Party to be eligible for duty-free or preferential tariff treatment that the importing and exporting Parties mutually agree fall within: (a) (b) hand-loomed fabrics of a cottage industry; hand-printed fabrics with a pattern created with a wax-resistance technique; hand-made cottage industry goods made of such hand-loomed or hand-printed fabrics; or traditional folklore handicraft goods;

(c)

(d)

provided that any requirements agreed by the importing and exporting Parties for such treatment are met.

Article 4.3: Emergency Actions 1. Subject to this Article if, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, a textile or apparel good benefiting from preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement is being imported into the territory of a Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to the domestic market for that good, and under such conditions as to cause serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good, the importing Party may, to the extent and for such

4-3

time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such damage and to facilitate adjustment, take emergency action in accordance with paragraph 6, consisting of an increase in the rate of duty on the good of the exporting Party or Parties to a level not to exceed the lesser of: (a) the most-favoured-nation applied rate of customs duty in effect at the time the action is taken; and the most-favoured nation applied rate of customs duty in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of this Agreement for the importing Party.

(b)

2. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to limit the rights and obligations of a Party under Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the Safeguards Agreement, or Chapter 6 (Trade Remedies). 3. In determining serious damage, or actual threat thereof, the importing Party: (a) shall examine the effect of increased imports from the exporting Party or Parties of a textile or apparel good benefiting from preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement on the particular industry, as reflected in changes in such relevant economic variables as output, productivity, utilisation of capacity, inventories, market share, exports, wages, employment, domestic prices, profits and investment, none of which either alone or combined with other factors shall necessarily be decisive; and shall not consider changes in technology or consumer preference in the importing Party as factors supporting a determination of serious damage, or actual threat thereof.

(b)

4. The importing Party may take an emergency action under this Article on ly following its publication of procedures that identify the criteria for a finding of serious damage, or actual threat thereof, and an investigation by its competent authorities. Such an investigation must use data based on the factors described in paragraph 3(a) that serious damage or actual threat thereof is demonstrably caused by increased imports of the product concerned as a result of this Agreement. 5. The importing Party shall submit to the exporting Party or Parties, without delay, written notice of the initiation of the investigation provided for in paragraph 4, as well as of its intent to take emergency action and, on the request of the exporting Party or Parties, shall enter into consultations with that Party or Parties regarding the matter. The importing Party shall provide the exporting Party or Parties with the full details of the emergency action to be taken. The Parties concerned shall begin consultations without delay and, unless otherwise decided, shall complete them within 60 days of receipt of the request. After

4-4

completion of the consultations, the importing Party shall notify the exporting Party or Parties of any decision. If it decides to take an emergency action, the notification shall include the details of the emergency action, including when it will take effect. 6. The following conditions and limitations shall apply to any emergency action taken under this Article: (a) no emergency action shall be maintained for a period exceeding two years unless extended for an additional period of up to two years; no emergency action shall be taken or maintained beyond the expiration of the transition period; no emergency action shall be taken by an importing Party against any particular good of another Party or Parties more than once; and on termination of the emergency action, the importing Party shall accord to the good that was subject to the emergency action the tariff treatment that would have been in effect but for the emergency action.

(b)

(c)

(d)

7. The Party taking an emergency action under this Article shall provide to the exporting Party or Parties against whose goods the emergency action is taken mutually agreed trade liberalising compensation in the form of concessions either having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the emergency action. Such concessions shall be limited to textile and apparel goods, unless the Parties concerned otherwise agree. If the Parties concerned are unable to agree on compensation within 60 days or a longer period agreed by the Parties concerned, the Party or Parties against whose good the emergency action is taken may take tariff action that has trade effects substantially equivalent to the trade effects of the emergency action taken under this Article. The tariff action may be taken against any goods of the Party taking the emergency action. The Party taking the tariff action shall apply it only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent trade effects. The importing Party's obligation to provide trade compensation and the exporting Party's right to take tariff action shall terminate when the emergency action terminates. 8. No Party shall take or maintain an emergency action under this Article against a textile or apparel good that is subject, or becomes subject, to a transitional safeguard measure under Chapter 6 (Trade Remedies), or to a safeguard measure that a Party takes pursuant to Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the Safeguards Agreement.

4-5

9. The investigations referred to in this Article shall be carried out according to procedures established by each Party. Each Party shall, on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party or before it initiates an investigation, notify the other Parties of these procedures. 10. Each Party shall, in any year where it takes or maintains an emergency action under this Article, provide a report on such actions to the other Parties.

Article 4.4: Cooperation 1. Each Party shall, in accordance with its laws and regulations, cooperate with other Parties for the purposes of enforcing or assisting in the enforcement of their respective measures concerning customs offences for trade in textile or apparel goods between the Parties, including ensuring the accuracy of claims for preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement. 2. Each Party shall take appropriate measures, which may include legislative, administrative, judicial or other action for: (a) enforcement of its laws, regulations and procedures related to customs offences; and cooperation with an importing Party in the enforcement of its laws, regulations and procedures related to the prevention of customs offences.

(b)

3. For the purposes of paragraph 2, "appropriate measures" means measures a Party takes, in accordance with its laws, regulations and procedures, such as: (a) providing its government officials with the legal authority to meet the obligations under this Chapter; enabling its law enforcement officials to identify and address customs offences; establishing or maintaining criminal, civil or administrative penalties that are aimed at deterring customs offences; undertaking appropriate enforcement action when it believes, based on a request from another Party that includes relevant facts, that a customs offence has occurred or is occurring in the requested Party's territory with regard to a textile or apparel good, including in free trade zones of the requested Party; and cooperating with another Party, on request, to establish facts regarding customs offences in the requested Party's territory with

regard to a textile or apparel good, including in free trade zones of the requested Party. 4. A Party may request information from another Party if it has relevant facts, such as historical evidence, indicating that a customs offence is occurring or is likely to occur. 5. Any request under paragraph 4 shall be made in writing, by electronic means or any other method that acknowledges receipt, and shall include a brief statement of the matter at issue, the cooperation requested, the relevant facts indicating a customs offence, and sufficient information for the requested Party to respond in accordance with its laws and regulations. 6. To enhance cooperative efforts under this Article between Parties to prevent and address customs offences, a Party that receives a request under paragraph 4 shall, subject to its laws, regulations and procedures, including those related to confidentiality referred to in Article 4.9.4 (Confidentiality) provide to the requesting Party, upon receipt of a request in accordance with paragraph 5, available information on the existence of an importer, exporter or producer, goods of an importer, exporter or producer, or other matters related to this Chapter. The information may include any available correspondence, reports, bills of lading, invoices, order contracts or other information regarding enforcement of laws or regulations related to the request. 7. A Party may provide information requested in this Article on paper or in electronic form. 8. Each Party shall designate and notify a contact point for cooperation under this Chapter in accordance with Article 27.5 (Contact Points) and shall notify the other Parties promptly of any subsequent changes.

Article 4.5: Monitoring 1. Each Party shall establish or maintain programmes or practices to identify and address textiles and apparel customs offences. This may include programmes or practices to ensure the accuracy of claims for preferential tariff treatment for textile and apparel goods under this Agreement. 2. Through those programmes or practices, a Party may collect or share information related to textiles or apparel goods for use for risk management purposes. 3. In addition to paragraphs 1 and 2, some Parties have bilateral agreements that apply between those Parties.

4-7

Article 4.6: Verification 1. An importing Party may conduct a verification with respect to a textile or apparel good pursuant to Article 3.27.1(a), Article 3.27.1(b) or Article 3.27.1(e) (Verification of Origin) and their associated procedures to verify whether a good qualifies for preferential tariff treatment or through a request for a site visit as described in this Article.3 2. An importing Party may request a site visit under this Article from an exporter or producer of textile or apparel goods to verify whether: (a) a textile or apparel good qualifies for preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement; or customs offences are occurring or have occurred.

(b)

3. During a site visit under this Article, an importing Party may request access to: (a) records and facilities relevant to the claim for preferential tariff treatment; or records and facilities relevant to the customs offences being verified.

(e)

whether the importer claimed preferential tariff treatment.

5. On receipt of information on a proposed visit under paragraph 2, the host Party may request information from the importing Party to facilitate planning of the visit, such as logistical arrangements or provision of requested assistance. 6. If an importing Party seeks to conduct a site visit under paragraph 2, it shall provide the host Party, as soon as practicable and prior to the date of the first visit to an exporter or producer under this Article, with a list of the names and addresses of the exporters or producers it proposes to visit. 7. If an importing Party seeks to conduct a site visit under paragraph 2: (a) officials of the host Party may accompany the officials of the importing Party during the site visit; officials of the host Party may, in accordance with its laws and regulations, on request of the importing Party or on its own initiative, assist the officials of the importing Party during the site visit and provide, to the extent available, information relevant to conduct the site visit; the importing and host Parties shall limit communication regarding the site visit to relevant government officials and shall not inform the exporter or producer outside the government of the host Party in advance of a visit or provide any other verification or enforcement information not publicly available whose disclosure could undermine the effectiveness of the action; the importing Party shall request permission from the exporter or producer4 for access to the relevant records or facilities, no later than the time of the visit. Unless advance notice would undermine the effectiveness of the site visit, the importing Party shall request permission with appropriate advance notice; and if the exporter or producer of textile or apparel goods denies such permission or access, the visit will not occur. The importing Party shall give consideration to any reasonable alternative dates proposed, taking into account the availability of relevant employees or facilities of the person visited.

If advance notice was not given under paragraph 7(d), that importer, exporter or producer may request an additional 30 days. 10. The importing Party shall not reject a claim for preferential tariff treatment on the sole grounds that the host Party does not provide the requested assistance or information under this Article. 11. While a verification is being conducted under this Article, the importing Party may take appropriate measures under procedures established in its laws and regulations, including suspending or denying the application of preferential tariff treatment to textile or apparel goods of the exporter or producer subject to a verification. 12. If verifications of identical textile or apparel goods by an importing Party indicate a pattern of conduct by an exporter or producer of false or unsupported representations that a textile or apparel good imported into its territory qualifies for preferential tariff treatment, the importing Party may withhold preferential tariff treatment for identical textile or apparel goods imported, exported or produced by that person until it is demonstrated to the importing Party that those identical textile or apparel goods qualify for preferential tariff treatment. For the purposes of this paragraph, "identical textile or apparel goods" means textile or apparel goods that are the same in all respects relevant to the particular rule of origin that qualifies the goods as originating.

A Party that declines to issue an advance ruling shall promptly notify the requester in writing, setting out the relevant facts and circumstances and the basis for its decision to decline to issue the advance ruling. 3. Each Party shall provide that its advance rulings shall take effect on the date that they are issued or on another date specified in the ruling, and remain in effect for at least three years, provided that the law, facts and circumstances on which the ruling is based remain unchanged. If a Party's law provides that an advance ruling becomes ineffective after a fixed period of time, that Party shall endeavour to provide procedures that allow the requester to renew the ruling expeditiously before it becomes ineffective, in situations in which the law, facts and circumstances on which the ruling was based remain unchanged. 4.

Each Party shall adopt or maintain measures that allow for the imposition of a penalty by a Party's customs administration for a breach of its customs laws, regulations or procedural requirements, including those governing tariff classification, customs valuation, country of origin and claims for preferential treatment under this Agreement. 2. Each Party shall ensure that a penalty imposed by its customs administration for a breach of a customs law, regulation or procedural requirement is imposed only on the person legally responsible for the breach. 3. Each Party shall ensure that the penalty imposed by its customs administration is dependent on the facts and circumstances9 of the case and is commensurate with the degree and severity of the breach. 4. Each Party shall ensure that it maintains measures to avoid conflicts of interest in the assessment and collection of penalties and duties. No portion of the remuneration of a government official shall be calculated as a fixed portion or percentage of any penalties or duties assessed or collected. 5. Each Party shall ensure that if a penalty is imposed by its customs administration for a breach of a customs law, regulation or procedural requirement, an explanation in writing is provided to the person upon whom the penalty is imposed specifying the nature of the breach and the law, regulation or procedure used for determining the penalty amount.

If a person voluntarily discloses to a Party's customs administration the circumstances of a breach of a customs law, regulation or procedural requirement prior to the discovery of the breach by the customs administration, the Party's customs administration shall, if appropriate, consider this fact as a potential mitigating factor when a penalty is established for that person. 7. Each Party shall provide in its laws, regulations or procedures, or otherwise give effect to, a fixed and finite period within which its customs administration may initiate proceedings10 to impose a penalty relating to a breach of a customs law, regulation or procedural requirement. 8. Notwithstanding paragraph 7, a customs administration may impose, outside of the fixed and finite period, a penalty where this is in lieu of judicial or administrative tribunal proceedings.

Article 5.9: Risk Management 1. Each Party shall adopt or maintain a risk management system for assessment and targeting that enables its customs administration to focus its inspection activities on high-risk goods and that simplifies the clearance and movement of low-risk goods. 2. In order to facilitate trade, each Party shall periodically review and update, as appropriate, the risk management system specified in paragraph 1.

Article 5.10: Release of Goods 1. Each Party shall adopt or maintain simplified customs procedures for the efficient release of goods in order to facilitate trade between the Parties. This paragraph shall not require a Party to release a good if its requirements for release have not been met. 2. that: Pursuant to paragraph 1, each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures

(a)

provide for the release of goods within a period no longer than that required to ensure compliance with its customs laws and, to the extent possible, within 48 hours of the arrival of the goods; provide for the electronic submission and processing of customs information in advance of the arrival of the goods in order to expedite the release of goods from customs control upon arrival;

(b)

(c)

allow goods to be released at the point of arrival without temporary transfer to warehouses or other facilities; and allow an importer to obtain the release of goods prior to the final determination of customs duties, taxes and fees by the importing Party's customs administration when these are not determined prior to or promptly upon arrival, provided that the good is otherwise eligible for release and any security required by the importing Party has been provided or payment under protest, if required by a Party, has been made. Payment under protest refers to payment of duties, taxes and fees if the amount is in dispute and procedures are available to resolve the dispute.

(d)

3. If a Party allows for the release of goods conditioned on a security, it shall adopt or maintain procedures that: (a) ensure that the amount of the security is no greater than that required to ensure that obligations arising from the importation of the goods will be fulfilled; ensure that the security shall be discharged as soon as possible after its customs administration is satisfied that the obligations arising from the importation of the goods have been fulfilled; and allow importers to provide security using non-cash financial instruments, including, in appropriate cases where an importer frequently enters goods, instruments covering multiple entries.

To the extent possible, each Party shall publish in advance regulations of general application governing customs matters that it proposes to adopt and shall provide interested persons the opportunity to comment before the Party adopts the regulation.

5-9

Article 5.12: Confidentiality 1. If a Party provides information to another Party in accordance with this Chapter and designates the information as confidential, the other Party shall keep the information confidential. The Party that provides the information may require the other Party to furnish written assurance that the information will be held in confidence, used only for the purposes specified in the other Party's request for information, and not disclosed without the specific permission of the Party that provided the information or the person that provided the information to that Party. 2. A Party may decline to provide information requested by another Party if that Party has failed to act in accordance with paragraph 1. 3. Each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures for protecting from unauthorised disclosure confidential information submitted in accordance with the administration of the Party's customs laws, including information the disclosure of which could prejudice the competitive position of the person providing the information.

A Party shall maintain a transitional safeguard measure only for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. 2. That period shall not exceed two years, except that the period may be extended by up to one year if the competent authority of the Party that applies the measure determines, in conformity with the procedures set out in Article 6.5 (Investigation Procedures and Transparency Requirements), that the transitional safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment. 3. No Party shall maintain a transitional safeguard measure beyond the expiration of the transition period. 4. In order to facilitate adjustment in a situation where the expected duration of a transitional safeguard measure is over one year, the Party that applies the measure shall progressively liberalise it at regular intervals during the period of application. 5. On the termination of a transitional safeguard measure, the Party that applied the measure shall apply the rate of customs duty set out in the Party's

6-3

Schedule to Annex 2-D (Tariff Commitments) as if that Party had never applied the transitional safeguard measure. 6. No Party shall apply a transitional safeguard measure more than once on the same good.

Article 6.5: Investigation Procedures and Transparency Requirements 1. A Party shall apply a transitional safeguard measure only following an investigation by the Party's competent authorities in accordance with Article 3 and Article 4.2(c) of the Safeguards Agreement; to this end, Article 3 and Article 4.2(c) of the Safeguards Agreement are incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis. 2.

Article 6.6: Notification and Consultation 1. A Party shall promptly notify the other Parties, in writing, if it: (a) (b) initiates a transitional safeguard investigation under this Chapter; makes a finding of serious injury, or threat of serious injury, caused by increased imports, as set out in Article 6.3 (Imposition of a Transitional Safeguard Measure); takes a decision to apply or extend a transitional safeguard measure; and takes a decision to modify a transitional safeguard measure previously undertaken.

(c)

(d)

2. A Party shall provide to the other Parties a copy of the public version of the report of its competent authorities that is required under Article 6.5.1 (Investigation Procedures and Transparency Requirements). 3. When a Party makes a notification pursuant to paragraph 1(c) that it is applying or extending a transitional safeguard measure, that Party shall include in that notification: (a) evidence of serious injury, or threat of serious injury, caused by increased imports of an originating good of another Party or Parties

6-4

(c) (d)

(e)

4. On request of a Party whose good is subject to a transitional safeguard proceeding under this Chapter, the Party that conducts that proceeding shall enter into consultations with the requesting Party to review a notification under paragraph 1 or any public notice or report that the competent investigating authority issued in connection with the proceeding.

Article 6.7: Compensation 1. A Party applying a transitional safeguard measure shall, after consultations with each Party against whose good the transitional safeguard measure is applied, provide mutually agreed trade liberalising compensation in the form of concessions that have substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the transitional safeguard measure. The Party shall provide an opportunity for those consultations no later than 30 days after the application of the transitional safeguard measure. 2. If the consultations under paragraph 1 do not result in an agreement on trade liberalising compensation within 30 days, any Party against whose good the transitional safeguard measure is applied may suspend the application of substantially equivalent concessions to the trade of the Party applying the transitional safeguard measure. 3. A Party against whose good the transitional safeguard measure is applied shall notify the Party applying the transitional safeguard measure in writing at least 30 days before it suspends concessions in accordance with paragraph 2. 4.

6-6

Annex 6-A Practices Relating to Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings

The Parties recognise, in Article 6.8 (Antidumping and Countervailing Duties), the right of the Parties to apply trade remedy measures consistent with Article VI of GATT 1994, the AD Agreement and the SCM Agreement, and further recognise the following practices1 as promoting the goals of transparency and due process in trade remedy proceedings: (a) Upon receipt by a Party's investigating authorities of a properly documented antidumping or countervailing duty application with respect to imports from another Party, and no later than seven days before initiating an investigation, the Party provides written notification of its receipt of the application to the other Party. In any proceeding in which the investigating authorities determine to conduct an in-person verification of information that is provided by a respondent,2 and that is pertinent to the calculation of antidumping duty margins or the level of a countervailable subsidy, the investigating authorities promptly notify each respondent of their intent, and: (i) provide to each respondent at least 10 working days advance notice of the dates on which the authorities intend to conduct an in-person verification of the information; at least five working days prior to an in-person verification, provide to the respondent a document that sets out the topics the respondent should be prepared to address during the verification and that describes the types of supporting documentation to be made available for review; and

(b)

(ii)

1

The practices included in this Annex do not constitute a comprehensive list of practices relating to antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings. No inference shall be drawn from the inclusion or exclusion of a particular aspect of such proceedings in this list.
2

For the purposes of this paragraph, "respondent" means a producer, manufacturer, exporter, importer, and, where appropriate, a government or government entity, that is required by a Party's investigating authorities to respond to an antidumping or countervailing duty questionnaire.

6-7

(iii)

after an in-person verification is completed, and subject to the protection of confidential information3, issue a written report that describes the methods and procedures followed in carrying out the verification and the extent to which the information provided by the respondent was supported by the documents reviewed during the verification. The report is made available to all interested parties in sufficient time for the parties to defend their interests.

(c)

A Party's investigating authorities maintain a public file for each investigation and review that contains: (i) all non-confidential documents that are part of the record of the investigation or review; and to the extent feasible without revealing confidential information, non-confidential summaries of confidential information that is contained in the record of each investigation or review. To the extent that individual information is not susceptible of summarisation, it may be aggregated by the investigating authority.

(ii)

The public file and a list of all documents that are contained in the record of the investigation or review are physically available for inspection and copying during the investigating authorities' normal business hours or electronically available for download.4 (d) If, in an antidumping or countervailing duty action that involves imports from another Party, a Party's investigating authorities determine that a timely response to a request for information does not comply with the request, the investigating authorities inform the interested party that submitted the response of the nature of the deficiency and, to the extent practicable in light of time limits established to complete the antidumping or countervailing duty action, provide that interested party with an opportunity to remedy or explain the deficiency. If that interested party submits further information in response to that deficiency and the investigating authorities find that the response is not satisfactory, or that the response is not submitted within the applicable time limits, and if the investigating authorities disregard all or part of the original and

For the purposes of this Annex, "confidential information" includes information which is provided on a confidential basis and which is by its nature confidential, for example, because its disclosure would be of significant competitive advantage to a competitor or because its disclosure would have a significantly adverse effect upon a person supplying the information or upon a person from whom that person acquired the information.

subsequent responses, the investigating authorities explain in the determination or other written document the reasons for disregarding the information. (e) Before a final determination is made, the investigating authorities inform all interested parties of the essential facts that form the basis of the decision whether to apply definitive measures. Subject to the protection of confidential information, the investigating authorities may use any reasonable means to disclose the essential facts, which includes a report summarising the data in the record, a draft or preliminary determination or some combination of those reports or determinations, to provide interested parties an opportunity to respond to the disclosure of essential facts.

CHAPTER 7 SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES

Article 7.1: Definitions 1. The definitions in Annex A of the SPS Agreement are incorporated into this Chapter and shall form part of this Chapter, mutatis mutandis. 2. In addition, for the purposes of this Chapter:

competent authority means a government body of each Party responsible for measures and matters referred to in this Chapter; emergency measure means a sanitary or phytosanitary measure that is applied by an importing Party to another Party to address an urgent problem of human, animal or plant life or health protection that arises or threatens to arise in the Party applying the measure; import check means an inspection, examination, sampling, review of documentation, test or procedure, including laboratory, organoleptic or identity, conducted at the border by an importing Party or its representative to determine if a consignment complies1 with the sanitary and phytosanitary requirements of the importing Party; import programme means mandatory sanitary or phytosanitary policies, procedures or requirements of an importing Party that govern the importation of goods; primary representative means the government body of a Party that is responsible for the implementation of this Chapter and the coordination of that Party's participation in Committee activities under Article 7.5 (Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures); risk analysis means the process that consists of three components: risk assessment; risk management; and risk communication; risk communication means the exchange of information and opinions concerning risk and risk-related factors between risk assessors, risk managers, consumers and other interested parties; and

1

For greater certainty, the Parties recognise that import checks are one of many tools available to assess compliance with an importing Party's sanitary and phytosanitary measures.

7-1

risk management means the weighing of policy alternatives in light of the results of risk assessment and, if required, selecting and implementing appropriate control options, including regulatory measures.

Article 7.2: Objectives The objectives of this Chapter are to: (a) protect human, animal or plant life or health in the territories of the Parties while facilitating and expanding trade by utilising a variety of means to address and seek to resolve sanitary and phytosanitary issues; reinforce and build on the SPS Agreement; strengthen communication, consultation and cooperation between the Parties, and particularly between the Parties' competent authorities and primary representatives; ensure that sanitary or phytosanitary measures implemented by a Party do not create unjustified obstacles to trade; enhance transparency in and understanding of the application of each Party's sanitary and phytosanitary measures; and encourage the development and adoption of international standards, guidelines and recommendations, and promote their implementation by the Parties.

Article 7.4: General Provisions 1. The Parties affirm their rights and obligations under the SPS Agreement.

2. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the rights and obligations that each Party has under the SPS Agreement.

7-2

Article 7.5: Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures 1. For the purposes of the effective implementation and operation of this Chapter, the Parties hereby establish a Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (Committee), composed of government representatives of each Party responsible for sanitary and phytosanitary matters. 2. The objectives of the Committee are to: (a) (b) (c) enhance each Party's implementation of this Chapter; consider sanitary and phytosanitary matters of mutual interest; and enhance communication and cooperation on sanitary and phytosanitary matters.

3.

The Committee: (a) shall provide a forum to improve the Parties' understanding of sanitary and phytosanitary issues that relate to the implementation of the SPS Agreement and this Chapter; shall provide a forum to enhance mutual understanding of each Party's sanitary and phytosanitary measures and the regulatory processes that relate to those measures; shall exchange information on the implementation of this Chapter; shall determine the appropriate means, which may include ad hoc working groups, to undertake specific tasks related to the functions of the Committee; may identify and develop technical assistance and cooperation projects between the Parties on sanitary and phytosanitary measures; may serve as a forum for a Party to share information on a sanitary or phytosanitary issue that has arisen between it and another Party or Parties, provided that the Parties between which the issue has arisen have first attempted to address the issue through discussions between themselves; and may consult on matters and positions for the meetings of the Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures established under Article 12 of the SPS Agreement (WTO SPS Committee), and meetings held under the auspices of the Codex Alimentarius

Commission, the World Organisation for Animal Health and the International Plant Protection Convention. 4. The Committee shall establish its terms of reference at its first meeting and may revise those terms as needed. 5. The Committee shall meet within one year of the date of entry into force of this Agreement and once a year thereafter unless Parties agree otherwise.

Article 7.6: Competent Authorities and Contact Points Each Party shall provide the other Parties with a written description of the sanitary and phytosanitary responsibilities of its competent authorities and contact points within each of these authorities and identify its primary representative within 60 days of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party. Each Party shall keep this information up to date.

Article 7.7: Adaptation to Regional Conditions, Including Pest- or DiseaseFree Areas and Areas of Low Pest or Disease Prevalence 1. The Parties recognise that adaptation to regional conditions, including regionalisation, zoning and compartmentalisation, is an important means to facilitate trade. 2. The Parties shall take into account the relevant guidance of the WTO SPS Committee and international standards, guidelines and recommendations. 3. The Parties may cooperate on the recognition of pest- or disease-free areas, and areas of low pest or disease prevalence with the objective of acquiring confidence in the procedures followed by each Party for the recognition of pestor disease-free areas, and areas of low pest or disease prevalence. 4. When an importing Party receives a request for a determination of regional conditions from an exporting Party and determines that the information provided by the exporting Party is sufficient, it shall initiate an assessment within a reasonable period of time. 5. When an importing Party commences an assessment of a request for a determination of regional conditions under paragraph 4, that Party shall promptly, on request of the exporting Party, explain its process for making the determination of regional conditions. 6. On request of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall inform the exporting Party of the status of the assessment of the exporting Party's request for a determination of regional conditions.

7-4

7. When an importing Party adopts a measure that recognises specific regional conditions of an exporting Party, the importing Party shall communicate that measure to the exporting Party in writing and implement the measure within a reasonable period of time. 8. The importing and exporting Parties involved in a particular determination may also decide in advance the risk management measures that will apply to trade between them in the event of a change in the status. 9. The Parties involved in a determination recognising regional conditions are encouraged, if mutually agreed, to report the outcome to the Committee. 10. If the evaluation of the evidence provided by the exporting Party does not result in a determination to recognise pest- or disease-free areas, or areas of low pest and disease prevalence, the importing Party shall provide the exporting Party with the rationale for its determination. 11. If there is an incident that results in the importing Party modifying or revoking the determination recognising regional conditions, on request of the exporting Party, the Parties involved shall cooperate to assess whether the determination can be reinstated.

Article 7.8: Equivalence 1. The Parties acknowledge that recognition of the equivalence of sanitary and phytosanitary measures is an important means to facilitate trade. Further to Article 4 of the SPS Agreement, the Parties shall apply equivalence to a group of measures or on a systems-wide basis, to the extent feasible and appropriate. In determining the equivalence of a specific sanitary or phytosanitary measure, group of measures or on a systems-wide basis, each Party shall take into account the relevant guidance of the WTO SPS Committee and international standards, guidelines and recommendations. 2. On request of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall explain the objective and rationale of its sanitary or phytosanitary measure and clearly identify the risk the sanitary or phytosanitary measure is intended to address. 3. When an importing Party receives a request for an equivalence assessment and determines that the information provided by the exporting Party is sufficient, it shall initiate the equivalence assessment within a reasonable period of time. 4. When an importing Party commences an equivalence assessment, that Party shall promptly, on request of the exporting Party, explain its equivalence process and plan for making the equivalence determination and, if the determination results in recognition, for enabling trade.

7-5

5. In determining the equivalence of a sanitary or phytosanitary measure, an importing Party shall take into account available knowledge, information and relevant experience, as well as the regulatory competence of the exporting Party. 6. The importing Party shall recognise the equivalence of a sanitary or phytosanitary measure if the exporting Party objectively demonstrates to the importing Party that the exporting Party's measure: (a) achieves the same level of protection as the importing Party's measure; or has the same effect in achieving the objective as the importing Party's measure.2

(b)

7. When an importing Party adopts a measure that recognises the equivalence of an exporting Party's specific sanitary or phytosanitary measure, group of measures or measures on a systems-wide basis, the importing Party shall communicate the measure it has adopted to the exporting Party in writing and implement the measure within a reasonable period of time. 8. The Parties involved in an equivalence determination that results in recognition are encouraged, if mutually agreed, to report the outcome to the Committee. 9. If an equivalence determination does not result in recognition by the importing Party, the importing Party shall provide the exporting Party with the rationale for its decision.

Article 7.9: Science and Risk Analysis 1. The Parties recognise the importance of ensuring that their respective sanitary and phytosanitary measures are based on scientific principles. 2. Each Party shall ensure that its sanitary and phytosanitary measures either conform to the relevant international standards, guidelines or recommendations or, if its sanitary and phytosanitary measures do not conform to international standards, guidelines or recommendations, that they are based on documented and objective scientific evidence that is rationally related to the measures, while recognising the Parties' obligations regarding assessment of risk under Article 5 of the SPS Agreement.3
2

No Party shall have recourse to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) for this subparagraph.
3

No Party shall have recourse to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) for this paragraph.

7-6

3. Recognising the Parties' rights and obligations under the relevant provisions of the SPS Agreement, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from: (a) (b) establishing the level of protection it determines to be appropriate; establishing or maintaining an approval procedure that requires a risk analysis to be conducted before the Party grants a product access to its market; or adopting or maintaining a sanitary or phytosanitary measure on a provisional basis.

(c)

4.

Each Party shall: (a) ensure that its sanitary and phytosanitary measures do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between Parties where identical or similar conditions prevail, including between its own territory and that of other Parties; and conduct its risk analysis in a manner that is documented and that provides interested persons and other Parties an opportunity to comment, in a manner to be determined by that Party.4

(b)

5. Each Party shall ensure that each risk assessment it conducts is appropriate to the circumstances of the risk at issue and takes into account reasonably available and relevant scientific data, including qualitative and quantitative information. 6. When conducting its risk analysis, each Party shall: (a) take into account relevant guidance of the WTO SPS Committee and international standards, guidelines and recommendations; consider risk management options that are not more trade restrictive5 than required, including the facilitation of trade by not taking any measure, to achieve the level of protection that the Party has determined to be appropriate; and

(b)

4

For greater certainty, this subparagraph applies only to a risk analysis for a sanitary or phytosanitary measure that constitutes a sanitary or phytosanitary regulation for the purposes of Annex B of the SPS Agreement.
5

For the purposes of subparagraphs (b) and (c), a risk management option is not more traderestrictive than required unless there is another option reasonably available, taking into account technical and economic feasibility, that achieves the appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection and is significantly less restrictive to trade.

7-7

(c)

select a risk management option that is not more trade restrictive than required to achieve the sanitary or phytosanitary objective, taking into account technical and economic feasibility.

7. If an importing Party requires a risk analysis to evaluate a request from an exporting Party to authorise importation of a good of that exporting Party, the importing Party shall provide, on request of the exporting Party, an explanation of the information required for the risk assessment. On receipt of the required information from the exporting Party, the importing Party shall endeavour to facilitate the evaluation of the request for authorisation by scheduling work on this request in accordance with the procedures, policies, resources, and laws and regulations of the importing Party. 8. On request of the exporting Party, the importing Party shall inform the exporting Party of the progress of a specific risk analysis request, and of any delay that may occur during the process. 9. If the importing Party, as a result of a risk analysis, adopts a sanitary or phytosanitary measure that allows trade to commence or resume, the importing Party shall implement the measure within a reasonable period of time. 10. Without prejudice to Article 7.14 (Emergency Measures), no Party shall stop the importation of a good of another Party solely for the reason that the importing Party is undertaking a review of its sanitary or phytosanitary measure, if the importing Party permitted the importation of that good of the other Party when the review was initiated. Article 7.10: Audits6 1. To determine an exporting Party's ability to provide required assurances and meet the sanitary and phytosanitary measures of the importing Party, each importing Party shall have the right, subject to this Article, to audit the exporting Party's competent authorities and associated or designated inspection systems. That audit may include an assessment of the competent authorities' control programmes, including: if appropriate, reviews of the inspection and audit programmes; and on-site inspections of facilities. 2. An audit shall be systems-based and designed to check the effectiveness of the regulatory controls of the competent authorities of the exporting Party.

6

For greater certainty, nothing in this Article prevents an importing Party from performing an inspection of a facility for the purposes of determining if the facility conforms with the importing Party's sanitary or phytosanitary requirements or conforms with sanitary or phytosanitary requirements that the importing Party has determined to be equivalent to its sanitary or phytosanitary requirements.

7-8

3. In undertaking an audit, a Party shall take into account relevant guidance of the WTO SPS Committee and international standards, guidelines and recommendations. 4. Prior to the commencement of an audit, the importing Party and exporting Party involved shall discuss the rationale and decide: the objectives and scope of the audit; the criteria or requirements against which the exporting Party will be assessed; and the itinerary and procedures for conducting the audit. 5. The auditing Party shall provide the audited Party the opportunity to comment on the findings of the audit and take any such comments into account before the auditing Party makes its conclusions and takes any action. The auditing Party shall provide a report setting out its conclusions in writing to the audited Party within a reasonable period of time. 6. A decision or action taken by the auditing Party as a result of the audit shall be supported by objective evidence and data that can be verified, taking into account the auditing Party's knowledge of, relevant experience with, and confidence in, the audited Party. This objective evidence and data shall be provided to the audited Party on request. 7. The costs incurred by the auditing Party shall be borne by the auditing Party, unless both Parties decide otherwise. 8. The auditing Party and audited Party shall each ensure that procedures are in place to prevent the disclosure of confidential information that is acquired during the audit process.

Article 7.11: Import Checks 1. Each Party shall ensure that its import programmes are based on the risks associated with importations, and the import checks are carried out without undue delay.7 2. A Party shall make available to another Party, on request, information on its import procedures and its basis for determining the nature and frequency of import checks, including the factors it considers to determine the risks associated with importations. 3. A Party may amend the frequency of its import checks as a result of experience gained through import checks or as a result of actions or discussions provided for in this Chapter.

7

For greater certainty, nothing in this Article prohibits a Party from performing import checks to obtain information to assess risk or to determine the need for, develop or periodically review a risk-based import programme.

7-9

4. An importing Party shall provide to another Party, on request, information regarding the analytical methods, quality controls, sampling procedures and facilities that the importing Party uses to test a good. The importing Party shall ensure that any testing is conducted using appropriate and validated methods in a facility that operates under a quality assurance programme that is consistent with international laboratory standards. The importing Party shall maintain physical or electronic documentation regarding the identification, collection, sampling, transportation and storage of the test sample, and the analytical methods used on the test sample. 5. An importing Party shall ensure that its final decision in response to a finding of non-conformity with the importing Party's sanitary or phytosanitary measure, is limited to what is reasonable and necessary, and is rationally related to the available science. 6. If an importing Party prohibits or restricts the importation of a good of another Party on the basis of an adverse result of an import check, the importing Party shall provide a notification about the adverse result to at least one of the following: the importer or its agent; the exporter; the manufacturer; or the exporting Party. 7. When the importing Party provides a notification pursuant to paragraph 6, it shall: (a) include: (i) (ii) (iii) the reason for the prohibition or restriction; the legal basis or authorisation for the action; and information on the status of the affected goods and, if appropriate, on their disposition;

(b)

do so in a manner consistent with its laws, regulations and requirements as soon as possible and no later than seven days8 after the date of the decision to prohibit or restrict, unless the good is seized by a customs administration; and if the notification has not already been provided through another channel, transmit the notification by electronic means, if practicable.

(c)

8. An importing Party that prohibits or restricts the importation of a good of another Party on the basis of an adverse result of an import check shall provide an opportunity for a review of the decision and consider any relevant information

For the purposes of this paragraph, the term "days" does not include national holidays of the importing Party.

7-10

submitted to assist in the review. The review request and information should be submitted to the importing Party within a reasonable period of time.9 9. If an importing Party determines that there is a significant, sustained or recurring pattern of non-conformity with a sanitary or phytosanitary measure, the importing Party shall notify the exporting Party of the non-conformity. 10. On request, an importing Party shall provide to the exporting Party available information on goods from the exporting Party that were found not to conform to a sanitary or phytosanitary measure of the importing Party.

Article 7.12: Certification 1. The Parties recognise that assurances with respect to sanitary or phytosanitary requirements may be provided through means other than certificates and that different systems may be capable of meeting the same sanitary or phytosanitary objective. 2. If an importing Party requires certification for trade in a good, the Party shall ensure that the certification requirement is applied, in meeting the Party's sanitary or phytosanitary objectives, only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health. 3. In applying certification requirements, an importing Party shall take into account relevant guidance of the WTO SPS Committee and international standards, guidelines and recommendations. 4. An importing Party shall limit attestations and information it requires on the certificates to essential information that is related to the sanitary or phytosanitary objectives of the importing Party. 5. An importing Party should provide to another Party, on request, the rationale for any attestations or information that the importing Party requires to be included on a certificate. 6. The Parties may agree to work cooperatively to develop model certificates to accompany specific goods traded between the Parties, taking into account relevant guidance of the WTO SPS Committee and international standards, guidelines and recommendations. 7. The Parties shall promote the implementation of electronic certification and other technologies to facilitate trade.

9

For greater certainty, nothing in this Article prevents an importing Party from disposing of goods which are found to have an infectious pathogen or pest that, if urgent action is not taken, can spread and cause damage to human, animal or plant life or health in the Party's territory.

7-11

Article 7.13: Transparency10 1. The Parties recognise the value of sharing information about their sanitary and phytosanitary measures on an ongoing basis, and of providing interested persons and other Parties with the opportunity to comment on their proposed sanitary and phytosanitary measures. 2. In implementing this Article, each Party shall take into account relevant guidance of the WTO SPS Committee and international standards, guidelines and recommendations. 3. A Party shall notify a proposed sanitary or phytosanitary measure that may have an effect on the trade of another Party, including any that conforms to international standards, guidelines or recommendations, by using the WTO SPS notification submission system as a means of notifying the other Parties. 4. Unless urgent problems of human, animal or plant life or health protection arise or threaten to arise, or the measure is of a trade-facilitating nature, a Party shall normally allow at least 60 days for interested persons and other Parties to provide written comments on the proposed measure after it makes the notification under paragraph 3. If feasible and appropriate, the Party should allow more than 60 days. The Party shall consider any reasonable request from an interested person or another Party to extend the comment period. On request of another Party, the Party shall respond to the written comments of the other Party in an appropriate manner. 5. The Party shall make available to the public, by electronic means in an official journal or on a website, the proposed sanitary or phytosanitary measure notified under paragraph 3, the legal basis for the measure, and the written comments or a summary of the written comments that the Party has received from the public on the measure. 6. If a Party proposes a sanitary or phytosanitary measure which does not conform to an international standard, guideline or recommendation, the Party shall provide to another Party, on request, and to the extent permitted by the confidentiality and privacy requirements of the Party's law, the relevant documentation that the Party considered in developing the proposed measure, including documented and objective scientific evidence that is rationally related to the measure, such as risk assessments, relevant studies and expert opinions. 7. A Party that proposes to adopt a sanitary or phytosanitary measure shall discuss with another Party, on request and if appropriate and feasible, any scientific or trade concerns that the other Party may raise regarding the proposed

For greater certainty, this Article applies only to a sanitary or phytosanitary measure that constitutes a sanitary or phytosanitary regulation for the purposes of Annex B of the SPS Agreement.

7-12

measure and the availability of alternative, less trade-restrictive approaches for achieving the objective of the measure. 8. Each Party shall publish, preferably by electronic means, notices of final sanitary or phytosanitary measures in an official journal or website. 9. Each Party shall notify the other Parties of final sanitary or phytosanitary measures through the WTO SPS notification submission system. Each Party shall ensure that the text or the notice of a final sanitary or phytosanitary measure specifies the date on which the measure takes effect and the legal basis for the measure. A Party shall also make available to another Party, on request, and to the extent permitted by the confidentiality and privacy requirements of the Party's law, significant written comments and relevant documentation considered to support the measure that were received during the comment period. 10. If a final sanitary or phytosanitary measure is substantively altered from the proposed measure, a Party shall also include in the notice of the final sanitary or phytosanitary measure that it publishes, an explanation of: (a) the objective and rationale of the measure and how the measure advances that objective and rationale; and any substantive revisions that it made to the proposed measure.

(b)

11. An exporting Party shall notify the importing Party through the contact points referred to in Article 7.6 (Competent Authorities and Contact Points) in a timely and appropriate manner: (a) if it has knowledge of a significant sanitary or phytosanitary risk related to the export of a good from its territory; of urgent situations where a change in animal or plant health status in the territory of the exporting Party may affect current trade; of significant changes in the status of a regionalised pest or disease; of new scientific findings of importance which affect the regulatory response with respect to food safety, pests or diseases; and of significant changes in food safety, pest or disease management, control or eradication policies or practices that may affect current trade.

(b)

(c) (d)

(e)

12. If feasible and appropriate, a Party should provide an interval of more than six months between the date it publishes a final sanitary or phytosanitary measure and the date on which the measure takes effect, unless the measure is intended to

7-13

address an urgent problem of human, animal or plant life or health protection or the measure is of a trade-facilitating nature. 13. A Party shall provide to another Party, on request, all sanitary or phytosanitary measures related to the importation of a good into that Party's territory.

Article 7.14: Emergency Measures 1. If a Party adopts an emergency measure that is necessary for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, the Party shall promptly notify the other Parties of that measure through the primary representative and the relevant contact point referred to in Article 7.6 (Competent Authorities and Contact Points). The Party that adopts the emergency measure shall take into consideration any information provided by other Parties in response to the notification. 2. If a Party adopts an emergency measure, it shall review the scientific basis of that measure within six months and make available the results of the review to any Party on request. If the emergency measure is maintained after the review, because the reason for its adoption remains, the Party should review the measure periodically.

Article 7.15: Cooperation 1. The Parties shall explore opportunities for further cooperation, collaboration and information exchange between the Parties on sanitary and phytosanitary matters of mutual interest, consistent with this Chapter. Those opportunities may include trade facilitation initiatives and technical assistance. The Parties shall cooperate to facilitate the implementation of this Chapter. 2. The Parties shall cooperate and may jointly identify work on sanitary and phytosanitary matters with the goal of eliminating unnecessary obstacles to trade between the Parties.

Article 7.16: Information Exchange A Party may request information from another Party on a matter arising under this Chapter. A Party that receives a request for information shall endeavour to provide available information to the requesting Party within a reasonable period of time, and if possible, by electronic means.

7-14

Article 7.17: Cooperative Technical Consultations 1. If a Party has concerns regarding any matter arising under this Chapter with another Party, it shall endeavour to resolve the matter by using the administrative procedures that the other Party's competent authority has available. If the relevant Parties have bilateral or other mechanisms available to address the matter, the Party raising the matter shall endeavour to resolve the matter through those mechanisms, if it considers that it is appropriate to do so. A Party may have recourse to the Cooperative Technical Consultations (CTC) set out in paragraph 2 at any time it considers that the continued use of the administrative procedures or bilateral or other mechanisms would not resolve the matter. 2. One or more Parties (requesting Party) may initiate CTC with another Party (responding Party) to discuss any matter arising under this Chapter that the requesting Party considers may adversely affect its trade by delivering a request to the primary representative of the responding Party. The request shall be in writing and identify the reason for the request, including a description of the requesting Party's concerns about the matter, and set out the provisions of this Chapter that relate to the matter. 3. Unless the requesting Party and the responding Party (the consulting Parties) agree otherwise, the responding Party shall acknowledge the request in writing within seven days of the date of its receipt. 4. Unless the consulting Parties agree otherwise, the consulting Parties shall meet within 30 days of the responding Party's acknowledgement of the request to discuss the matter identified in the request, with the aim of resolving the matter within 180 days of the request if possible. The meeting shall be in person or by electronic means. 5. The consulting Parties shall ensure the appropriate involvement of relevant trade and regulatory agencies in meetings held pursuant to this Article. 6. All communications between the consulting Parties in the course of CTC, as well as all documents generated for CTC, shall be kept confidential unless the consulting Parties agree otherwise and without prejudice to the rights and obligations of any Party under this Agreement, the WTO Agreement or any other international agreement to which it is a party. 7. The requesting Party may cease CTC proceedings under this Article and have recourse to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) if: (a) the meeting referred to in paragraph 4 does not take place within 37 days of the date of the request, or such other timeframe as the consulting Parties may agree under paragraphs 3 and 4; or

7-15

(b)

the meeting referred to in paragraph 4 has been held.

8. No Party shall have recourse to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) for a matter arising under this Chapter without first seeking to resolve the matter through CTC in accordance with this Article.

Article 7.18: Dispute Settlement 1. Unless otherwise provided in this Chapter, Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) shall apply to this Chapter, subject to the following: (a) with respect to Article 7.8 (Equivalence), Article 7.10 (Audits) and Article 7.11 (Import Checks), Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) shall apply with respect to a responding Party as of one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party; and with respect to Article 7.9 (Science and Risk Analysis), Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) shall apply with respect to a responding Party as of two years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party.

(b)

2. In a dispute under this Chapter that involves scientific or technical issues, a panel should seek advice from experts chosen by the panel in consultation with the Parties involved in the dispute. To this end, the panel may, if it deems appropriate, establish an advisory technical experts group, or consult the relevant international standard setting organisations, at the request of either Party to the dispute or on its own initiative.

CHAPTER 8 TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE

Article 8.1: Definitions 1. The definitions of the terms used in this Chapter contained in Annex 1 of the TBT Agreement, including the chapeau and explanatory notes of Annex 1, are incorporated into this Chapter and shall form part of this Chapter, mutatis mutandis. 2. In addition, for the purposes of this Chapter:

consular transactions means requirements that products of a Party intended for export to the territory of another Party must first be submitted to the supervision of the consul of the importing Party in the territory of the exporting Party for the purpose of obtaining consular invoices or consular visas for conformity assessment documentation; marketing authorisation means the process or processes by which a Party approves or registers a product in order to authorise its marketing, distribution or sale in the Party's territory. The process or processes may be described in a Party's laws or regulations in various ways, including "marketing authorisation", "authorisation", "approval", "registration", "sanitary authorisation", "sanitary registration" and "sanitary approval" for a product. Marketing authorisation does not include notification procedures; mutual recognition agreement means a binding government-to-government agreement for recognition of the results of conformity assessment conducted against the appropriate technical regulations or standards in one or more sectors, including government-to-government agreements to implement the APEC Mutual Recognition Arrangement for Conformity Assessment of Telecommunications Equipment of May 8, 1998 and the Electrical and Electronic Equipment Mutual Recognition Arrangement of July 7, 1999 and other agreements that provide for the recognition of conformity assessment conducted against appropriate technical regulations or standards in one or more sectors; mutual recognition arrangement means an international or regional arrangement (including a multilateral recognition arrangement) between accreditation bodies recognising the equivalence of accreditation systems (based on peer review) or between conformity assessment bodies recognising the results of conformity assessment;

8-1

post-market surveillance means procedures taken by a Party after a product has been placed on its market to enable the Party to monitor or address compliance with the Party's domestic requirements for products; TBT Agreement means the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, as may be amended; and verify means to take action to confirm the veracity of individual conformity assessment results, such as requesting information from the conformity assessment body or the body that accredited, approved, licensed or otherwise recognised the conformity assessment body, but does not include requirements that subject a product to conformity assessment in the territory of the importing Party that duplicate the conformity assessment procedures already conducted with respect to the product in the territory of the exporting Party or a third party, except on a random or infrequent basis for the purpose of surveillance, or in response to information indicating non-compliance.

Article 8.2: Objective The objective of this Chapter is to facilitate trade, including by eliminating unnecessary technical barriers to trade, enhancing transparency, and promoting greater regulatory cooperation and good regulatory practice.

Article 8.3: Scope 1. This Chapter shall apply to the preparation, adoption and application of all technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures of central level of government bodies (and, where explicitly provided for, technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures of government bodies at the level directly below that of the central level of government) that may affect trade in goods between the Parties, except as provided in paragraphs 4 and 5. 2. Each Party shall take reasonable measures that are within its authority to encourage observance by regional or local government bodies, as the case may be, on the level directly below that of the central level of government within its territory which are responsible for the preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures, of Article 8.5 (International Standards, Guides and Recommendations), Article 8.6 (Conformity Assessment), Article 8.8 (Compliance Period for Technical Regulations and Conformity Assessment Procedures) and each of the Annexes to this Chapter. 3. All references in this Chapter to technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures shall be construed to include any amendments

8-2

to them and any addition to the rules or the product coverage of those technical regulations, standards and procedures, except amendments and additions of an insignificant nature. 4. This Chapter shall not apply to technical specifications prepared by a governmental entity for its production or consumption requirements. These specifications are covered by Chapter 15 (Government Procurement). 5. This Chapter shall not apply to sanitary and phytosanitary measures. These are covered by Chapter 7 (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures). 6. For greater certainty, nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining technical regulations, standards or conformity assessment procedures in accordance with its rights and obligations under this Agreement, the TBT Agreement and any other relevant international agreement.

Article 8.4: Incorporation of Certain Provisions of the TBT Agreement 1. The following provisions of the TBT Agreement are incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis: (a) (b) (c) Articles 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12; Articles 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9; and paragraphs D, E and F of Annex 3.

2. No Party shall have recourse to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) for a dispute that exclusively alleges a violation of the provisions of the TBT Agreement incorporated under paragraph 1.

Article 8.5: International Standards, Guides and Recommendations 1. The Parties recognise the important role that international standards, guides and recommendations can play in supporting greater regulatory alignment, good regulatory practice and reducing unnecessary barriers to trade. 2. In this respect, and further to Articles 2.4 and 5.4 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement, to determine whether there is an international standard, guide or recommendation within the meaning of Articles 2 and 5 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement, each Party shall apply the Decisions and Recommendations adopted by the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade Since 1 January 1995 (G/TBT/1/Rev.12), as may be revised, issued by the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade.

8-3

3. The Parties shall cooperate with each other, when feasible and appropriate, to ensure that international standards, guides and recommendations that are likely to become a basis for technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade.

Article 8.6: Conformity Assessment 1. Further to Article 6.4 of the TBT Agreement, each Party shall accord to conformity assessment bodies located in the territory of another Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords to conformity assessment bodies located in its own territory or in the territory of any other Party. In order to ensure that it accords such treatment, each Party shall apply the same or equivalent procedures, criteria and other conditions to accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognise conformity assessment bodies located in the territory of another Party that it may apply to conformity assessment bodies in its own territory. 2. Further to Article 6.4 of the TBT Agreement, if a Party maintains procedures, criteria or other conditions as set out in paragraph 1 and requires test results, certifications or inspections as positive assurance that a product conforms to a technical regulation or standard, the Party: (a) shall not require the conformity assessment body that tests or certifies the product, or the conformity assessment body conducting an inspection, to be located within its territory; shall not impose requirements on conformity assessment bodies located outside its territory that would effectively require those conformity assessment bodies to operate an office in that Party's territory; and shall permit conformity assessment bodies in other Parties' territories to apply to the Party for a determination that they comply with any procedures, criteria and other conditions the Party requires to deem them competent or to otherwise approve them to test or certify the product or conduct an inspection.

(b)

(c)

3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not preclude a Party from undertaking conformity assessment in relation to a specific product solely within specified government bodies located in its own territory or in another Party's territory, in a manner consistent with its obligations under the TBT Agreement. 4. If a Party undertakes conformity assessment under paragraph 3, and further to Articles 5.2 and 5.4 of the TBT Agreement concerning limitation on information requirements, the protection of legitimate commercial interests and the adequacy of review procedures, the Party shall, on the request of another Party, explain:

8-4

(a)

how the information required is necessary to assess conformity and determine fees; how the Party ensures that the confidentiality of the information required is respected in a manner that ensures legitimate commercial interests are protected; and the procedure to review complaints concerning the operation of the conformity assessment procedure and to take corrective action when a complaint is justified.

(b)

(c)

5. Paragraphs 1 and 2(c) shall not preclude a Party from using mutual recognition agreements to accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognise conformity assessment bodies located outside its territory. 6. Nothing in paragraphs 1, 2 and 5 precludes a Party from verifying the results of conformity assessment procedures undertaken by conformity assessment bodies located outside its territory. 7. Further to paragraph 6, in order to enhance confidence in the continued reliability of conformity assessment results from the Parties' respective territories, a Party may request information on matters pertaining to conformity assessment bodies located outside its territory. 8. Further to Article 9.1 of the TBT Agreement, a Party shall consider adopting measures to approve conformity assessment bodies that have accreditation for the technical regulations or standards of the importing Party, by an accreditation body that is a signatory to an international or regional mutual recognition arrangement. 1 The Parties recognise that these arrangements can address the key considerations in approving conformity assessment bodies, including technical competence, independence, and the avoidance of conflicts of interest. 9. Further to Article 9.2 of the TBT Agreement no Party shall refuse to accept conformity assessment results from a conformity assessment body or take actions that have the effect of, directly or indirectly, requiring or encouraging another Party or person to refuse to accept conformity assessment results from a conformity assessment body because the accreditation body that accredited the conformity assessment body: (a) operates in the territory of a Party where there is more than one accreditation body; is a non-governmental body;

(b)
1

The Committee shall be responsible for developing and maintaining a list of such arrangements.

8-5

(c)

is domiciled in the territory of a Party that does not maintain a procedure for recognising accreditation bodies, provided that the accreditation body is recognised internationally, consistent with the provisions in paragraph 8; does not operate an office in the Party's territory; or is a for-profit entity.

(d) (e)

10. Nothing in paragraph 9 prohibits a Party from refusing to accept conformity assessment results from a conformity assessment body on grounds other than those set out in paragraph 9 if that Party can substantiate those grounds for the refusal, and that refusal is not inconsistent with the TBT Agreement and this Chapter. 11. A Party shall publish, preferably by electronic means, any procedures, criteria and other conditions that it may use as the basis for determining whether conformity assessment bodies are competent to receive accreditation, approval, licensing or other recognition, including accreditation, approval, licensing or other recognition granted pursuant to a mutual recognition agreement. 12. If a Party: (a) accredits, approves, licenses or otherwise recognises a body assessing conformity with a particular technical regulation or standard in its territory, and refuses to accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognise a body assessing conformity with that technical regulation or standard in the territory of another Party; or declines to use a mutual recognition arrangement,

(b)

it shall, on request of the other Party, explain the reasons for its decision. 13. If a Party does not accept the results of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in the territory of another Party, it shall, on the request of the other Party, explain the reasons for its decision. 14. Further to Article 6.3 of the TBT Agreement, if a Party declines the request of another Party to enter into negotiations to conclude an agreement for mutual recognition of the results of each other's conformity assessment procedures, it shall, on request of that other Party, explain the reasons for its decision. 15. Further to Article 5.2.5 of the TBT Agreement any conformity assessment fees imposed by a Party shall be limited to the approximate cost of services rendered.

8-6

16. No Party shall require consular transactions, including related fees and charges, in connection with conformity assessment. 2

Article 8.7: Transparency 1. Each Party shall allow persons of another Party to participate in the development of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures by its central government bodies 3 on terms no less favourable than those that it accords to its own persons. 2. Each Party is encouraged to consider methods to provide additional transparency in the development of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures, including through the use of electronic tools and public outreach or consultations. 3. If appropriate, each Party shall encourage non-governmental bodies in its territory to observe the obligations in paragraphs 1 and 2. 4. Each Party shall publish all proposals for new technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and proposals for amendments to existing technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, and all new final technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and final amendments to existing technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, of central government bodies. 5. A Party may determine the form of proposals for technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, which may take the form of: policy proposals; discussion documents; summaries of proposed technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures; or the draft text of proposed technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures. Each Party shall ensure that its proposals contain sufficient detail about the likely content of the proposed technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures to adequately inform interested persons and other Parties about whether and how their trade interests might be affected. 6. Each Party shall publish preferably by electronic means, in a single official journal or website all proposals for new technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and proposals for amendments to existing technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, and all new final technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and final amendments to
2

For greater certainty, this paragraph shall not apply to a Party verifying conformity assessment documents during a marketing authorisation or reauthorisation process.

A Party satisfies this obligation by, for example, providing interested persons a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on the measure it proposes to develop and taking those comments into account in the development of the measure.

8-7

existing technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, of central government bodies, that a Party is required to notify or publish under the TBT Agreement or this Chapter, and that may have a significant effect on trade. 4 7. Each Party shall take such reasonable measures as may be available to it to ensure that all proposals for new technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and proposals for amendments to existing technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, and all new final technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and final amendments to existing technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, of regional or local governments, as the case may be, on the level directly below that of the central level of government, are published. 8. Each Party shall ensure that all new final technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and final amendments to existing technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, and to the extent practicable, all proposals for new technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and proposals for amendments to existing technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, of regional or local governments on the level directly below that of the central level of government are accessible through official websites or journals, preferably consolidated into a single website. 9. Each Party shall notify proposals for new technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures that are in accordance with the technical content of relevant international standards, guides or recommendations, if any, and that may have a significant effect on trade, according to the procedures established under Article 2.9 or 5.6 of the TBT Agreement. 10. Notwithstanding paragraph 9, if urgent problems of safety, health, environmental protection or national security arise or threaten to arise for a Party, that Party may notify a new technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure that is in accordance with the technical content of relevant international standards, guides or recommendations, if any, upon the adoption of that regulation or procedure, according to the procedures established under Article 2.10 or 5.7 of the TBT Agreement. 11. Each Party shall endeavour to notify proposals for new technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures of regional or local governments, as the case may be, on the level directly below that of the central level of government that are in accordance with the technical content of relevant international standards, guides and recommendations, if any, and that may have a significant effect on trade according to the procedures established under Article 2.9 or 5.6 of the TBT Agreement.

4

For greater certainty, a Party may comply with this obligation by ensuring that the proposed and final measures in this paragraph are published on, or otherwise accessible through, the WTO's official website.

8-8

12. For the purposes of determining whether a proposed technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure may have a significant effect on trade and should be notified in accordance with Article 2.9, 2.10, 3.2, 5.6, 5.7 or 7.2 of the TBT Agreement or this Chapter, a Party shall consider, among other things, the relevant Decisions and Recommendations Adopted by the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade Since 1 January 1995 (G/TBT/1/Rev. 12), as may be revised. 13. A Party that publishes a notice and that files a notification in accordance with Article 2.9, 3.2, 5.6 or 7.2 of the TBT Agreement or this Chapter shall: (a) include in the notification an explanation of the objectives of the proposal and how it would address those objectives; and transmit the notification and the proposal electronically to the other Parties through their enquiry points established in accordance with Article 10 of the TBT Agreement, at the same time as it notifies WTO Members.

(b)

14. Each Party shall normally allow 60 days from the date it transmits a proposal under paragraph 13 for another Party or an interested person of another Party to provide comments in writing on the proposal. A Party shall consider any reasonable request from another Party or an interested person of another Party to extend the comment period. A Party that is able to extend a time limit beyond 60 days, for example 90 days, is encouraged to do so. 15. Each Party is encouraged to provide sufficient time between the end of the comment period and the adoption of the notified technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure, for its consideration of, and preparation of responses to, the comments received. 16. Each Party shall endeavour to notify the final text of a technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure at the time the text is adopted or published, as an addendum to the original notification of the proposed measure filed under Article 2.9, 3.2, 5.6 or 7.2 of the TBT Agreement or this Chapter. 17. A Party that files a notification in accordance with Article 2.10 or 5.7 of the TBT Agreement and this Chapter shall, at the same time, transmit the notification and text of the technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure electronically to the other Parties through the enquiry points referred to in paragraph 13(b). 18. No later than the date of publication of a final technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure that may have a significant effect on trade, each Party shall, preferably electronically:

19. Further to paragraph J of Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement, each Party shall ensure that its central government standardising body's work programme, containing the standards it is currently preparing and the standards it has adopted, is available through the central government standardising body's website or the website referred to in paragraph 6.

Article 8.8: Compliance Period for Technical Regulations and Conformity Assessment Procedures 1. For the purposes of applying Articles 2.12 and 5.9 of the TBT Agreement the term "reasonable interval" means normally a period of not less than six months, except when this would be ineffective in fulfilling the legitimate objectives pursued by the technical regulation or by the requirements concerning the conformity assessment procedure. 2. If feasible and appropriate, each Party shall endeavour to provide an interval of more than six months between the publication of final technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and their entry into force. 3. In addition to paragraphs 1 and 2, in setting a "reasonable interval" for a specific technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure, each Party shall ensure that it provides suppliers with a reasonable period of time, under the

circumstances, to be able to demonstrate the conformity of their goods with the relevant requirements of the technical regulation or standard by the date of entry into force of the specific technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure. In doing so, each Party shall endeavour to take into account the resources available to suppliers.

Article 8.9: Cooperation and Trade Facilitation 1. Further to Articles 5, 6 and 9 of the TBT Agreement, the Parties acknowledge that a broad range of mechanisms exist to facilitate the acceptance of conformity assessment results. In this regard, a Party may: (a) implement mutual recognition of the results of conformity assessment procedures performed by bodies located in its territory and another Party's territory with respect to specific technical regulations; recognise existing regional and international mutual recognition arrangements between or among accreditation bodies or conformity assessment bodies; use accreditation to qualify conformity assessment bodies, particularly international systems of accreditation; designate conformity assessment bodies or recognise another Party's designation of conformity assessment bodies; unilaterally recognise the results of conformity assessment procedures performed in another Party's territory; and accept a supplier's declaration of conformity.

(f)

2. The Parties recognise that a broad range of mechanisms exist to support greater regulatory alignment and to eliminate unnecessary technical barriers to trade in the region, including: (a) regulatory dialogue and cooperation to, among other things: (i) exchange information on regulatory approaches and practices; promote the use of good regulatory practices to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures;

(ii)

8-11

(iii)

provide technical advice and assistance, on mutually agreed terms and conditions, to improve practices related to the development, implementation and review of technical regulations, standards, conformity assessment procedures and metrology; or provide technical assistance and cooperation, on mutually agreed terms and conditions, to build capacity and support the implementation of this Chapter;

(iv)

(b)

greater alignment of national standards with relevant international standards, except where inappropriate or ineffective; facilitation of the greater use of relevant international standards, guides and recommendations as the basis for technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures; and promotion of the acceptance of technical regulations of another Party as equivalent.

(c)

(d)

3. With respect to the mechanisms listed in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Parties recognise that the choice of the appropriate mechanism in a given regulatory context depends on a variety of factors, such as the product and sector involved, the volume and direction of trade, the relationship between Parties' respective regulators, the legitimate objectives pursued and the risks of non-fulfilment of those objectives. 4. The Parties shall strengthen their exchange and collaboration on mechanisms to facilitate the acceptance of conformity assessment results, to support greater regulatory alignment and to eliminate unnecessary technical barriers to trade in the region. 5. A Party shall, on request of another Party, give due consideration to any sector-specific proposal for cooperation under this Chapter. 6. Further to Article 2.7 of the TBT Agreement, a Party shall, on request of another Party, explain the reasons why it has not accepted a technical regulation of that Party as equivalent. 7. The Parties shall encourage cooperation between their respective organisations responsible for standardisation, conformity assessment, accreditation and metrology, whether they are public or private, with a view to addressing issues covered by this Chapter.

8-12

Article 8.10: Information Exchange and Technical Discussions 1. A Party may request another Party to provide information on any matter arising under this Chapter. A Party receiving a request under this paragraph shall provide that information within a reasonable period of time, and if possible, by electronic means. 2. A Party may request technical discussions with another Party with the aim of resolving any matter that arises under this Chapter. 3. For greater certainty, with respect to technical regulations or conformity assessment procedures of regional or local governments, as the case may be, on the level directly below that of the central government that may have a significant effect on trade, a Party may request technical discussions with another Party regarding those matters. 4. The relevant Parties shall discuss the matter raised within 60 days of the date of the request. If a requesting Party considers that the matter is urgent, it may request that any discussions take place within a shorter time frame. The responding Party shall give positive consideration to that request. 5. The Parties shall endeavour to resolve the matter as expeditiously as possible, recognising that the time required to resolve a matter will depend on a variety of factors, and that it may not be possible to resolve every matter through technical discussions. 6. Unless the Parties that participate in the technical discussions agree otherwise, the discussions and any information exchanged in the course of the discussions shall be confidential and without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the participating Parties under this Agreement, the WTO Agreement or any other agreement to which both Parties are party. 7. Requests for information or technical discussions and communications shall be conveyed through the respective contact points designated pursuant to Article 27.5 (Contact Points).

Article 8.11: Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade 1. The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (Committee), composed of government representatives of each Party. 2. Through the Committee, the Parties shall strengthen their joint work in the fields of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures with a view to facilitating trade between the Parties.

ANNEX 8-A WINE AND DISTILLED SPIRITS

1. 2.

This Annex shall apply to wine and distilled spirits. For the purposes of this Annex:

container means any bottle, barrel, cask or other closed receptacle, irrespective of size or of the material from which it is made, used for the retail sale of wine or distilled spirits; distilled spirits means a potable alcoholic distillate, including spirits of wine, whiskey, rum, brandy, gin, tequila, mezcal and all dilutions or mixtures of those spirits for consumption; label means any brand, mark, pictorial or other descriptive matter that is written, printed, stencilled, marked, embossed or impressed on, or firmly affixed to the primary container of wine or distilled spirits; oenological practices means winemaking materials, processes, treatments and techniques, but does not include labelling, bottling or packaging for final sale; single field of vision means any part of the surface of a primary container, excluding its base and cap, that can be seen without having to turn the container; supplier means a producer, importer, exporter, bottler or wholesaler; and wine means a beverage that is produced by the complete or partial alcoholic fermentation exclusively of fresh grapes, grape must, or products derived from fresh grapes in accordance with oenological practices that the country in which the wine is produced authorises under its laws and regulations. 6 3. Each Party shall make information about its laws and regulations concerning wine and distilled spirits publicly available. 4. A Party may require a supplier to ensure that any statement required by that Party to be placed on a wine or distilled spirits label is: (a) clear, specific, truthful, accurate and not misleading to the consumer; and

6

For the United States, the alcohol content of wine must be not less than seven per cent and not more than 24 per cent.

8-17

(b)

legible to the consumer; and

that such labels be firmly affixed. 5. If a Party requires a supplier to indicate information on a distilled spirits label, the Party shall permit the supplier to indicate that information on a supplementary label that is affixed to the distilled spirits container. Each Party shall permit a supplier to affix the supplementary label on the container of the imported distilled spirits after importation but prior to offering the product for sale in the Party's territory, and may require that the supplier affix the supplementary label prior to release from customs. For greater certainty, a Party may require that the information indicated on a supplementary label meet the requirements in paragraph 4. 6. Each Party shall permit the alcoholic content by volume indicated on a wine or distilled spirits label to be expressed by alcohol by volume (alc/vol), for example 12% alc/vol or alc12%vol, and to be indicated in percentage terms to a maximum of one decimal point, for example 12.1%. 7. Each Party shall permit suppliers to use the term "wine" as a product name. A Party may require a supplier to indicate additional information on a wine label concerning the type, category, class or classification of the wine. 8. With respect to wine labels, each Party shall permit the information set out in subparagraphs 10(a) through (d) to be presented in a single field of vision for a container of wine. If this information is presented in a single field of vision, then the Party's requirements with respect to placement of this information are satisfied. A Party shall accept any of the information that appears outside a single field of vision if that information satisfies that Party's laws, regulations and requirements. 9. Notwithstanding paragraph 8, a Party may require net contents to be displayed on the principal display panel for a subset of less commonly used container sizes if specifically required by that Party's laws or regulations. 10. If a Party requires a wine label to indicate information other than: (a) (b) (c) (d) product name; country of origin; net contents; or alcohol content,

it shall permit the supplier to indicate the information on a supplementary label affixed to the wine container. A Party shall permit the supplier to affix the

8-18

supplementary label on the container of the imported wine after importation but prior to offering the product for sale in the Party's territory, and may require that the supplier affix the supplementary label prior to release from customs. For greater certainty, a Party may require that information on a supplementary label meet the requirements set out in paragraph 4. 11. For the purposes of paragraphs 4, 5 and 10, if there is more than one label on a container of imported wine or distilled spirits, a Party may require that each label be visible and not obscure mandatory information on another label. 12. If a Party has more than one official language, it may require that information on a wine or distilled spirits label appear in equal prominence in each official language. 13. Each Party shall permit a supplier to place a lot identification code on a wine or distilled spirits container, if the code is clear, specific, truthful, accurate and not misleading, and shall permit the supplier to determine: (a) where to place the lot identification code on the container, provided that the code does not cover up essential information printed on the label; and the specific font size, readable phrasing and formatting for the code provided that the lot identification code is legible by physical or electronic means.

(b)

14. A Party may impose penalties for the removal or deliberate defacement of any lot identification code provided by the supplier and placed on the container. 15. No Party shall require a supplier to indicate any of the following information on a wine or distilled spirits container, labels or packaging: (a) (b) (c) (d) date of production or manufacture; date of expiration; date of minimum durability; or sell by date,

except that a Party may require a supplier to indicate a date of minimum durability or expiration on products 7 that could have a shorter date of minimum durability or expiration than would normally be expected by the consumer because of: their packaging or container, for example bag-in-box wines or individual serving size wines; or the addition of perishable ingredients.
7

For Peru, all distilled spirits with less than 10 % alc/vol must have a date of minimum durability.

8-19

16. No Party shall require a supplier to place a translation of a trademark or trade name on a wine or distilled spirits container, label or packaging. 17. No Party shall prevent imports of wine from other Parties solely on the basis that the wine label includes the following descriptors or adjectives describing the wine or relating to wine-making: chateau, classic, clos, cream, crusted/crusting, fine, late bottled vintage, noble, reserve, ruby, special reserve, solera, superior, sur lie, tawny, vintage or vintage character. This paragraph shall not apply to a Party that has entered into an agreement with another country or group of countries no later than February 2003 that requires the Party to restrict the use of such terms on labels of wine sold in its territory. 8 18. No Party shall require a supplier to disclose an oenological practice on a wine label or container except to meet a legitimate human health or safety objective with respect to that oenological practice. 19. Each Party shall permit wine to be labelled as Icewine, ice wine, ice-wine or a similar variation of those terms, only if the wine is made exclusively from grapes naturally frozen on the vine. 9 20. Each Party shall endeavour to base its quality and identity requirements for any specific type, category, class or classification of distilled spirits solely on minimum ethyl alcohol content and the raw materials, added ingredients and production procedures used to produce that specific type, category, class or classification of distilled spirits. 21. No Party shall require imported wine or distilled spirits to be certified by an official certification body of the Party in whose territory the wine or distilled spirits were produced or by a certification body recognised by the Party in whose territory the wine or distilled spirits were produced regarding: (a) (b) vintage, varietal and regional claims for wine; or raw materials and production processes for distilled spirits,

8

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require Canada to apply this paragraph in a manner inconsistent with its obligations under Article A(3) of Annex V of the EU-Canada Wine Agreement, as amended. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require Malaysia to apply this paragraph in a manner inconsistent with its Regulation 18(1A) of the Food Regulations 1985 under the Food Act 1983. For Japan, this obligation is met through implementation of "the standard on labelling of domestic wine" by its domestic producers, dated 23 December 1986, as amended. For New Zealand, the obligation in this paragraph will become effective three years after the date on which this Agreement enters into force for New Zealand. Once effective, New Zealand shall implement the obligation by ensuring that wine exported from New Zealand is labelled as icewine, ice wine, ice-wine, or a similar variation of these terms, only if such wine is made exclusively from grapes naturally frozen on the vine.

9

8-20

except that the Party may require that wine or distilled spirits be certified regarding (a) or (b) if the Party in whose territory the wine or distilled spirits were produced requires that certification, that wine be certified regarding (a) if the Party has a reasonable and legitimate concern about a vintage, varietal or regional claim for wine, or that distilled spirits be certified regarding (b) if certification is necessary to verify claims such as age, origin or standards of identity. 22. If a Party deems that certification of wine is necessary to protect human health or safety or to achieve other legitimate objectives, that Party shall consider the Codex Alimentarius Guidelines for Design, Production, Issuance and Use of Generic Official Certificates (CAC/GL 38-2001), in particular the use of the generic model official certificate, as amended from time-to-time, concerning official and officially recognised certificates. 23. A Party shall normally permit a wine or distilled spirits supplier to submit any required certification, test result or sample only with the initial shipment of a particular brand, producer and lot. If a Party requires a supplier to submit a sample of the product for the Party's procedure to assess conformity with its technical regulation or standard, it shall not require a sample quantity larger than the minimum quantity necessary to complete the relevant conformity assessment procedure. Nothing in this provision precludes a Party from undertaking verification of test results or certification, for example, where the Party has information that a particular product may be non-compliant. 24. Unless problems of human health or safety arise or threaten to arise for a Party, a Party shall not normally apply any final technical regulation, standard or conformity assessment procedure to wine or distilled spirits that have been placed on the market in the Party's territory before the date on which the technical regulation, standard or conformity assessment procedure enters into force, provided that the products are sold within a period of time after the date the technical regulation, standard or conformity assessment procedure enters into force, stipulated by the authority responsible for that technical regulation, standard or conformity assessment procedure. 25. Each Party shall endeavour to assess other Parties' laws, regulations and requirements in respect of oenological practices, with the aim of reaching agreements that provide for the Parties' acceptance of each other's mechanisms for regulating oenological practices, if appropriate.

8-21

ANNEX 8-B INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS

Section A: Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Products that Use Cryptography 1. This section shall apply to information and communication technology (ICT) products that use cryptography. 10 2. For the purposes of this section:

cryptography means the principles, means or methods for the transformation of data in order to hide its information content, prevent its undetected modification or prevent its unauthorised use; and is limited to the transformation of information using one or more secret parameters, for example, crypto variables, or associated key management; encryption means the conversion of data (plaintext) into a form that cannot be easily understood without subsequent re-conversion (ciphertext) through the use of a cryptographic algorithm; cryptographic algorithm or cipher means a mathematical procedure or formula for combining a key with plaintext to create a ciphertext; and key means a parameter used in conjunction with a cryptographic algorithm that determines its operation in such a way that an entity with knowledge of the key can reproduce or reverse the operation, while an entity without knowledge of the key cannot. 3. With respect to a product that uses cryptography and is designed for commercial applications, no Party shall impose or maintain a technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure that requires a manufacturer or supplier of the product, as a condition of the manufacture, sale, distribution, import or use of the product, to: (a) transfer or provide access to a particular technology, production process or other information, for example, a private key or other secret parameter, algorithm specification or other design detail, that is proprietary to the manufacturer or supplier and relates to the cryptography in the product, to the Party or a person in the Party's

For greater certainty, for the purposes of this section, a "product" is a good and does not include a financial instrument.

10

8-22

territory; (b) (c) partner with a person in its territory; or use or integrate a particular cryptographic algorithm or cipher,

other than where the manufacture, sale, distribution, import or use of the product is by or for the government of the Party. 4. Paragraph 3 shall not apply to: (a) requirements that a Party adopts or maintains relating to access to networks that are owned or controlled by the government of that Party, including those of central banks; or (b) measures taken by a Party pursuant to supervisory, investigatory or examination authority relating to financial institutions or markets. 5. For greater certainty, this Section shall not be construed to prevent a Party's law enforcement authorities from requiring service suppliers using encryption they control to provide, pursuant to that Party's legal procedures, unencrypted communications.

Section B: Electromagnetic Compatibility of Information Technology Equipment (ITE) Products 1. This section shall apply to the electromagnetic compatibility of information technology equipment (ITE) products. 2. For the purposes of this section:

ITE product means any device or system or component thereof that has a primary function of entry, storage, display, retrieval, transmission, processing, switching or control (or combinations thereof) of data or telecommunication messages by means other than radio transmission or reception and, for greater certainty, excludes any product or component thereof that has a primary function of radio transmission or reception; electromagnetic compatibility means the ability of an equipment or system to function satisfactorily in its electromagnetic environment without introducing intolerable electromagnetic disturbances with respect to any other device or system in that environment; and supplier's declaration of conformity means an attestation by a supplier that a product meets a specified standard or technical regulation based on an evaluation of the results of conformity assessment procedures. 3. If a Party requires positive assurance that an ITE product meets a standard or technical regulation for electromagnetic compatibility, it shall accept a

8-23

supplier's declaration of conformity. 11 4. The Parties recognise that a Party may require testing, for example, by an independent accredited laboratory, in support of a supplier's declaration of conformity, registration of the supplier's declaration of conformity, or submission of evidence necessary to support the supplier's declaration of conformity. 5. Nothing in paragraph 3 shall prevent a Party from verifying a supplier's declaration of conformity. 6. Paragraph 3 shall not apply with respect to a product: (a) that a Party regulates as a medical device, a medical device system or a component of a medical device or medical device system; or for which the Party demonstrates that there is a high risk that the product will cause harmful electromagnetic interference with a safety or radio transmission or reception device or system.

(b)

Section C: Regional Cooperation Activities on Telecommunications Equipment 1. This section shall apply to telecommunications equipment.

2. The Parties are encouraged to implement the APEC Mutual Recognition Arrangement for Conformity Assessment of Telecommunications Equipment of May 8, 1998 (MRA-TEL) and the APEC Mutual Recognition Arrangement for Equivalence of Technical Requirements of October 31, 2010 (MRA-ETR) with respect to each other or other arrangements to facilitate trade in telecommunications equipment.

11

Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require Mexico to apply this paragraph in a manner inconsistent with its Ley Federal Sobre Metrología y Normalización.

ANNEX 8-C PHARMACEUTICALS

1. This Annex shall apply to the preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations, standards, conformity assessment procedures, marketing authorisation 12 and notification procedures of central government bodies that may affect trade in pharmaceutical products between the Parties. This Annex shall not apply to a technical specification prepared by a governmental entity for its production or consumption requirements or a sanitary or phytosanitary measure. 2. A Party's obligations under this Annex shall apply to any product that the Party defines as a pharmaceutical product pursuant to paragraph 3. For the purposes of this Annex, preparation of a technical regulation, standard, conformity assessment procedure or marketing authorisation includes, as appropriate, the evaluation of the risks involved, the need to adopt a measure to address those risks, the review of relevant scientific or technical information, and the consideration of the characteristics or design of alternative approaches. 3. Each Party shall define the scope of the products subject to its laws and regulations for pharmaceutical products in its territory and make that information publicly available. 4. Recognising that each Party is required to define the scope of products covered by this Annex pursuant to paragraph 3, for the purposes of this Annex, a pharmaceutical product may include a human drug or biologic that is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of a disease or condition in humans, or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of a human. 5. Each Party shall identify the agency or agencies that are authorised to regulate pharmaceutical products in its territory and make that information publicly available. 6. If more than one agency is authorised to regulate pharmaceutical products within the territory of a Party, that Party shall examine whether there is overlap or duplication in the scope of those authorities and take reasonable measures to eliminate unnecessary duplication of any regulatory requirements resulting for pharmaceutical products.

The application of this Annex to marketing authorisations is without prejudice to whether a marketing authorisation meets the definition of a technical regulation, standard or conformity assessment procedure.

12

8-25

7. The Parties shall seek to collaborate through relevant international initiatives, such as those aimed at harmonisation, as well as regional initiatives that support those international initiatives, as appropriate, to improve the alignment of their respective regulations and regulatory activities for pharmaceutical products. 8. When developing or implementing regulations for marketing authorisation of pharmaceutical products, each Party shall consider relevant scientific or technical guidance documents developed through international collaborative efforts. Each Party is encouraged to consider regionally-developed scientific or technical guidance documents that are aligned with international efforts. 9. Each Party shall observe the obligations set out in Articles 2.1 and 5.1.1 of the TBT Agreement with respect to a marketing authorisation, notification procedure or elements of either that the Party prepares, adopts or applies for pharmaceutical products and that do not fall within the definition of a technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure. 10. Each Party recognises that the applicant is responsible for providing sufficient information to a Party for it to make a regulatory determination on a pharmaceutical product. 11. Each Party shall make its determination whether to grant marketing authorisation for a specific pharmaceutical product on the basis of: (a) information, including, if appropriate, pre-clinical and clinical data, on safety and efficacy; information on the manufacturing quality of the product; labelling information related to the safety, efficacy and use of the product; and other matters that may directly affect the health or safety of the user of the product.

(b) (c)

(d)

To this end, no Party shall require sale data or related financial data concerning the marketing of the product as part of the determination. Further, each Party shall endeavour to not require pricing data as part of the determination. 12. Each Party shall administer any marketing authorisation process that it maintains for pharmaceutical products in a timely, reasonable, objective, transparent and impartial manner, and identify and manage any conflicts of interest in order to mitigate any associated risks. (a) Each Party shall provide an applicant that requests marketing authorisation for a pharmaceutical product with its determination

8-26

within a reasonable period of time. The Parties recognise that the reasonable period of time required to make a marketing authorisation determination may be affected by factors such as the novelty of a product or regulatory implications that may arise. (b) If a Party determines that a marketing authorisation application for a pharmaceutical product under review in its jurisdiction has deficiencies that have led or will lead to a decision not to authorise its marketing, that Party shall inform the applicant that requests marketing authorisation and provide reasons why the application is deficient. If a Party requires a marketing authorisation for a pharmaceutical product, the Party shall ensure that any marketing authorisation determination is subject to an appeal or review process that may be invoked at the request of the applicant. For greater certainty, the Party may maintain an appeal or review process that is either internal to the regulatory body responsible for the marketing authorisation determination, such as a dispute resolution or review process, or external to the regulatory body. If a Party requires periodic re-authorisation for a pharmaceutical product that has previously received marketing authorisation from the Party, the Party shall allow the pharmaceutical product to remain on its market under the conditions of the previous marketing authorisation pending a decision on the periodic reauthorisation, unless the Party identifies a significant health or safety concern. 13, 14

(c)

(d)

13. When developing regulatory requirements for pharmaceutical products, a Party shall consider its available resources and technical capacity in order to minimise the implementation of requirements that could: (a) inhibit the effectiveness of procedures for ensuring the safety, efficacy or manufacturing quality of pharmaceutical products; or

For greater certainty, the Parties recognise that an application for reauthorisation that is not filed in a timely manner; that contains insufficient information; or that is otherwise inconsistent with a Party's requirements, is deficient for the purposes of the reauthorisation decision. Viet Nam may comply with its obligations under this paragraph by allowing for applications for reauthorisation to be filed within the 12-month period, prior to the expiry date of the marketing authorisation, or within a period prior to the expiry date of the marketing authorisation that is six months longer than the period provided for in Viet Nam's Ministry of Health Circular on Registration of Drugs, or subsequent relevant instrument, for the Ministry to grant a reauthorisation or re-registration application for a previously registered pharmaceutical products, whichever is longer.
14

(b)

lead to substantial delays in marketing authorisation regarding pharmaceutical products for sale on that Party's market.

14. No Party shall require that a pharmaceutical product receive marketing authorisation from a regulatory authority in the country of manufacture as a condition for the product to receive marketing authorisation from that Party. 15. For greater certainty, a Party may accept a prior marketing authorisation that is issued by another regulatory authority as evidence that a product may meet its own requirements. If there are regulatory resource limitations, a Party may require a marketing authorisation from one of a number of reference countries to be established and made public by that Party as a condition for the product's marketing authorisation from that Party. 16. For a marketing authorisation application for a pharmaceutical product, each Party shall review the safety, efficacy and manufacturing quality information submitted by the applicant requesting marketing authorisation in a format that is consistent with the principles found in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Common Technical Document (CTD), as may be amended, recognising that the CTD may not address all aspects relevant to a Party's determination to approve marketing authorisation for a particular product. 15 17. The Parties shall seek to improve their collaboration on pharmaceutical inspection, and to this end, each Party shall, with respect to the inspection of a pharmaceutical product within the territory of another Party: (a) notify the other Party prior to conducting an inspection, unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that doing so could prejudice the effectiveness of the inspection; if practicable, permit representatives of the other Party's competent authority to observe that inspection; and notify the other Party of its findings as soon as possible following the inspection and, if the findings will be publicly released, no later than a reasonable time before release. The inspecting Party is not required to notify the other Party of its findings if it considers that those findings are confidential and should not be disclosed.

ANNEX 8-D COSMETICS

1. This Annex shall apply to the preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations, standards, conformity assessment procedures, marketing authorisation 16 and notification procedures of central government bodies that may affect trade in cosmetic products between the Parties. This Annex shall not apply to a technical specification prepared by a governmental entity for its production or consumption requirements or a sanitary or phytosanitary measure. 2. A Party's obligations under this Annex shall apply to any product that the Party defines as a cosmetic product pursuant to paragraph 3. For the purposes of this Annex, preparation of a technical regulation, standard, conformity assessment procedure or marketing authorisation includes, as appropriate, the evaluation of the risks involved, the need to adopt a measure to address those risks, the review of relevant scientific or technical information, and the consideration of the characteristics or design of alternative approaches. 3. Each Party shall define the scope of the products subject to its laws and regulations for cosmetic products in its territory and make that information publicly available. 4. Recognising that each Party is required to define the scope of products covered by this Annex pursuant to paragraph 3, for the purposes of this Annex, a cosmetic product may include a product that is intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, sprayed on or otherwise applied to the human body including the mucous membrane of the oral cavity and teeth, to cleanse, beautify, protect, promote attractiveness or alter the appearance. 5. Each Party shall identify the agency or agencies that are authorised to regulate cosmetic products in its territory and make that information publicly available. 6. If more than one agency is authorised to regulate cosmetic products within the territory of a Party, that Party shall examine whether there is overlap or duplication in the scope of those authorities and eliminate unnecessary duplication of any regulatory requirements resulting for cosmetic products. 7. The Parties shall seek to collaborate through relevant international initiatives, such as those aimed at harmonisation, as well as regional initiatives
The application of this Annex to marketing authorisations is without prejudice to whether a marketing authorisation meets the definition of a technical regulation, standard or conformity assessment procedure.

that support of those international initiatives, as appropriate, to improve the alignment of their respective regulations and regulatory activities for cosmetic products. 8. When developing or implementing regulations for cosmetic products, each Party shall consider relevant scientific or technical guidance documents developed through international collaborative efforts. Each Party is encouraged to consider regionally-developed scientific or technical guidance documents that are aligned with international efforts. 9. Each Party shall observe the obligations set out in Articles 2.1 and 5.1.1 of the TBT Agreement with respect to a marketing authorisation, notification procedure or elements of either that the Party prepares, adopts or applies for cosmetic products and that do not fall within the definition of a technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure. 10. Each Party shall ensure that it applies a risk-based approach to the regulation of cosmetic products. 11. In applying a risk-based approach in regulating cosmetic products, each Party shall take into account that cosmetic products are generally expected to pose less potential risk to human health or safety than medical devices or pharmaceutical products. 12. No Party shall conduct separate marketing authorisation processes or subprocesses for cosmetic products that differ only with respect to shade extensions or fragrance variants, unless a Party identifies a significant human health or safety concern. 13. Each Party shall administer any marketing authorisation process that it maintains for cosmetics products in a timely, reasonable, objective, transparent and impartial manner, and identify and manage any conflicts of interest in order to mitigate any associated risks. (a) If a Party requires marketing authorisation for a cosmetic product, that Party shall provide an applicant with its determination within a reasonable period of time. If a Party requires marketing authorisation for a cosmetic product and it determines that a marketing authorisation application for a cosmetic product under review in its jurisdiction has deficiencies that have led or will lead to a decision not to authorise its marketing, that Party shall inform the applicant that requests marketing authorisation and provide reasons why the application is deficient.

(b)

8-30

(c)

If a Party requires a marketing authorisation for a cosmetic product, the Party shall ensure that any marketing authorisation determination is subject to an appeal or review process that may be invoked at the request of the applicant. For greater certainty, the Party may maintain an appeal or review process that is either internal to the regulatory body responsible for the marketing authorisation determination, such as a dispute resolution or review process, or external to the regulatory body. If a Party has granted marketing authorisation for a cosmetic product in its territory, the Party shall not subject the product to periodic re-assessment procedures as a condition of retaining its marketing authorisation.

(d)

14. If a Party maintains a marketing authorisation process for cosmetic products, that Party shall consider replacing this process with other mechanisms such as voluntary or mandatory notification and post-market surveillance. 15. When developing regulatory requirements for cosmetic products, a Party shall consider its available resources and technical capacity in order to minimise the implementation of requirements that could: (a) inhibit the effectiveness of procedures for ensuring the safety or manufacturing quality of cosmetic products; or lead to substantial delays in marketing authorisation regarding cosmetic products for sale on that Party's market.

(b)

16. No Party shall require the submission of marketing information, including with respect to prices or cost, as a condition for the product receiving marketing authorisation. 17. No Party shall require a cosmetic product to be labelled with a marketing authorisation or notification number. 17 18. No Party shall require that a cosmetic product receive marketing authorisation from a regulatory authority in the country of manufacture, as a condition for the product receiving marketing authorisation from the Party. For greater certainty, this provision does not prohibit a Party from accepting a prior marketing authorisation issued by another regulatory authority as evidence that a product may meet its own requirements.
17

This paragraph does not apply to Chile and Peru. Within a period of no more than five years from the date of the entry into force of this Agreement, Chile and Peru shall each review their respective labelling requirements in order to examine whether other regulatory mechanisms can be implemented, in a manner consistent with their obligations under this Chapter and the TBT Agreement. Chile and Peru shall separately report to the Committee about their review upon request of another Party.

8-31

19. No Party shall require that a cosmetic product be accompanied by a certificate of free sale as a condition of marketing, distribution or sale in the Party's territory. 20. If a Party requires a manufacturer or supplier of a cosmetic product to indicate information on the product's label, the Party shall permit the manufacturer or supplier to indicate the required information by relabelling the product or by using supplementary labelling of the product in accordance with the Party's domestic requirements after importation but prior to offering the product for sale or supply in the Party's territory. 21. No Party shall require that a cosmetic product be tested on animals to determine the safety of that cosmetic product, unless there is no validated alternative method available to assess safety. A Party may, however, consider the results of animal testing to determine the safety of a cosmetic product. 22. If a Party prepares or adopts good manufacturing practice guidelines for cosmetic products, it shall use relevant international standards for cosmetic products, or the relevant parts of them, as a basis for its guidelines unless those international standards or relevant parts would be an ineffective or inappropriate means for the fulfilment of the legitimate objectives pursued. 23. Each Party shall endeavour to share, subject to its laws and regulations, information from post-market surveillance of cosmetic products. 24. Each Party shall endeavour to share information on its findings or the findings of its relevant institutions regarding cosmetic ingredients. 25. Each Party shall endeavour to avoid re-testing or re-evaluating cosmetic products that differ only with respect to shade extensions or fragrance variants, unless conducted for human health or safety purposes.

ANNEX 8-E MEDICAL DEVICES

1. This Annex shall apply to the preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations, standards, conformity assessment procedures, marketing authorisation 18 and notification procedures of central government bodies that may affect trade in medical devices between the Parties. This Annex shall not apply to a technical specification prepared by a governmental entity for its production or consumption requirements or a sanitary or phytosanitary measure. 2. A Party's obligations under this Annex shall apply to any product that the Party defines as a medical device pursuant to paragraph 3. For the purposes of this Annex, preparation of a technical regulation, standard, conformity assessment procedure or marketing authorisation includes, as appropriate the evaluation of the risks involved, the need to adopt a measure to address those risks, the review of relevant scientific or technical information, and the consideration of the characteristics or design of alternative approaches. 3. Each Party shall define the scope of the products subject to its laws and regulations for medical devices in its territory and make that information publicly available. 4. Recognising that each Party is required to define the scope of products covered by this Annex pursuant to paragraph 3, each Party should define the scope of products subject to its laws and regulations for medical devices in a manner that is consistent with the meaning assigned to the term "medical device" in the Definition of the Terms `Medical Device' and `In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Medical Device' endorsed by the Global Harmonization Task Force on May 16, 2012, as may be amended. 5. Each Party shall identify the agency or agencies that are authorised to regulate medical devices in its territory and make that information publicly available. 6. If more than one agency is authorised to regulate medical devices within the territory of a Party, that Party shall examine whether there is overlap or duplication in the scope of those authorities and to take reasonable measures to eliminate unnecessary duplication of any regulatory requirements resulting for medical devices.

The application of this Annex to marketing authorisations is without prejudice to whether a marketing authorisation meets the definition of a technical regulation, standard, or conformity assessment procedure.

18

8-33

7. The Parties shall seek to collaborate through relevant international initiatives, such as those aimed at harmonisation, as well as regional initiatives that support of those international initiatives, as appropriate, to improve the alignment of their respective regulations and regulatory activities for medical devices. 8. When developing or implementing regulations for marketing authorisation of medical devices, each Party shall consider relevant scientific or technical guidance documents developed through international collaborative efforts. Each Party is encouraged to consider regionally-developed scientific or technical guidance documents that are aligned with international efforts. 9. Each Party shall observe the obligations set out in Articles 2.1 and 5.1.1 of the TBT Agreement with respect to a marketing authorisation, notification procedure or elements of either that the Party prepares, adopts or applies for medical devices and that do not fall within the definition of a technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure. 10. Recognising that different medical devices pose different levels of risk, each Party shall classify medical devices based on risk, taking into account scientifically relevant factors. Each Party shall ensure that, when it regulates a medical device, it regulates the device consistent with the classification the Party has assigned to that device. 11. Each Party recognises that the applicant is responsible for providing sufficient information to a Party for it to make a regulatory determination on a medical device. 12. Each Party shall make a determination whether to grant marketing authorisation for a specific medical device on the basis of: (a) information, including, if appropriate, clinical data, on safety and efficacy; information on performance, design and manufacturing quality of the device; labelling information related to safety, efficacy and use of the device; and other matters that may directly affect the health or safety of the user of the device.

(b)

(c)

(d)

To this end, no Party shall require sale data, pricing or related financial data concerning the marketing of the medical device.

8-34

13. Each Party shall administer any marketing authorisation process that it maintains for medical devices in a timely, reasonable, objective, transparent and impartial manner, and identify and manage any conflicts of interest in order to mitigate any associated risks. (a) Each Party shall provide an applicant that requests marketing authorisation for a medical device with its determination within a reasonable period of time. The Parties recognise that the reasonable period of time required to make a marketing authorisation determination may be affected by factors such as the novelty of a device or regulatory implications that may arise. If a Party determines that a marketing authorisation application for a medical device under review in its jurisdiction has deficiencies that have led or will lead to a decision not to authorise its marketing, that Party shall inform the applicant that requests marketing authorisation and provide reasons why the application is deficient. If a Party requires marketing authorisation for a medical device, the Party shall ensure that any marketing authorisation determination is subject to an appeal or review process that may be invoked at the request of the applicant. For greater certainty, the Party may maintain an appeal or review process that is either internal to the regulatory body responsible for the marketing authorisation determination, such as a dispute resolution or review process, or external to the regulatory body. If a Party requires periodic re-authorisation for a medical device that has previously received marketing authorisation from the Party, the Party shall allow the medical device to remain on its market under the conditions of the previous marketing authorisation pending a decision on the periodic re-authorisation, unless a Party identifies a significant health or safety concern.

(b)

(c)

(d)

14. When developing regulatory requirements for medical devices, a Party shall consider its available resources and technical capacity in order to minimise the implementation of requirements that could: (a) inhibit the effectiveness of procedures for ensuring the safety, efficacy or manufacturing quality of medical devices; or lead to substantial delays in marketing authorisation regarding medical devices for sale on that Party's market.

(b)

15. No Party shall require that a medical device receive a marketing authorisation from a regulatory authority in the country of manufacture as a

8-35

condition for the medical device to receive marketing authorisation from that Party. 16. For greater certainty, a Party may accept a prior marketing authorisation that is issued by another regulatory authority as evidence that a medical device may meet its own requirements. If there are regulatory resource limitations, a Party may require a marketing authorisation from one of a number of reference countries established and made public by that Party as a condition for the medical device's marketing authorisation from that Party. 17. If a Party requires a manufacturer or supplier of a medical device to indicate information on the product's label, the Party shall permit the manufacturer or supplier to indicate the required information by relabelling the product or by using supplementary labelling of the device in accordance with the Party's domestic requirements after importation but prior to offering the device for sale or supply in the Party's territory.

8-36

ANNEX 8-F PROPRIETARY FORMULAS FOR PREPACKAGED FOODS AND FOOD ADDITIVES

1. This Annex shall apply to the preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations and standards of central government bodies that are related to prepackaged foods and food additives. This Annex shall not apply to technical specifications prepared by a governmental entity for its production or consumption requirements or sanitary and phytosanitary measures. 2. For the purposes of this Annex, the terms "food," "food additive" and "prepackaged" have the same meanings as set out in the Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Pre-Packaged Food (CODEX STAN 1-1985) and the Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Food Additives When Sold as Such (CODEX STAN 107-1981), as may be amended. 3. When gathering information relating to proprietary formulas in the preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations and standards, each Party shall: (a) ensure that its information requirements are limited to what is necessary to achieve its legitimate objective; and ensure that the confidentiality of information about products originating in the territory of another Party arising from, or supplied in connection with, the preparation, adoption, and application of technical regulations and standards, is respected in the same way as for domestic products and in a manner that protects legitimate commercial interests.

(b)

If a Party gathers confidential information relating to proprietary formulas, it may use that information in the course of administrative and judicial proceedings in accordance with its law, provided that the Party has procedures to maintain the confidentiality of the information in the course of those proceedings. 4. Nothing in paragraph 3 shall prevent a Party from requiring ingredients to be listed on labels consistent with CODEX STAN 1-1985 and CODEX STAN 107-1981, as may be amended, except when those standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means for the fulfilment of a legitimate objective.

8-37

ANNEX 8-G ORGANIC PRODUCTS

1. This Annex shall apply to a Party if that Party is developing or maintains technical regulations, standards or conformity assessment procedures that relate to the production, processing or labelling of products as organic for sale or distribution within its territory. 2. Each Party is encouraged to take steps to: (a) exchange information on matters that relate to organic production, certification of organic products, and related control systems; and cooperate with other Parties to develop, improve and strengthen international guidelines, standards and recommendations that relate to trade in organic products.

(b)

3. If a Party maintains a requirement that relates to the production, processing or labelling of products as organic, it shall enforce that requirement. 4. A Party is encouraged to consider, as expeditiously as possible, a request from another Party for recognition or equivalence of a technical regulations, standards or conformity assessment procedures that relates to the production, processing, or labelling of products of another Party as organic. Each Party is encouraged to accept as equivalent or recognise the technical regulations, standards or conformity assessment procedures that relate to the production, processing or labelling of products of that other Party as organic, if the Party is satisfied that the technical regulations, standards or conformity assessment procedures of that other Party adequately fulfils the objectives of the Party's technical regulations, standards or conformity assessment procedures. If a Party does not accept as equivalent or recognise the technical regulations, standards or conformity assessment procedures that relate to the production, processing, or labelling of products of that other Party as organic, it shall, on request of that other Party, explain its reasons. 5. Each Party is encouraged to participate in technical exchanges to support improvement and greater alignment of technical regulations, standards or conformity assessment procedures that relate to the production, processing or labelling of products as organic.

CHAPTER 9 INVESTMENT

Section A Article 9.1: Definitions For the purposes of this Chapter: Centre means the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) established by the ICSID Convention; claimant means an investor of a Party that is a party to an investment dispute with another Party. If that investor is a natural person, who is a permanent resident of a Party and a national of another Party, that natural person may not submit a claim to arbitration against that latter Party; covered investment means, with respect to a Party, an investment in its territory of an investor of another Party in existence as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for those Parties or established, acquired, or expanded thereafter; disputing parties means the claimant and the respondent; disputing party means either the claimant or the respondent; enterprise means an enterprise as defined in Article 1.3 (General Definitions), and a branch of an enterprise; enterprise of a Party means an enterprise constituted or organised under the law of a Party, or a branch located in the territory of a Party and carrying out business activities there;1 freely usable currency means "freely usable currency" as determined by the International Monetary Fund under its Articles of Agreement; ICC Arbitration Rules means the arbitration rules of the International Chamber of Commerce;

1

For greater certainty, the inclusion of a "branch" in the definitions of "enterprise" and "enterprise of a Party" is without prejudice to a Party's ability to treat a branch under its laws as an entity that has no independent legal existence and is not separately organised.

9-1

ICSID Additional Facility Rules means the Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes; ICSID Convention means the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965; Inter-American Convention means the Inter-American Convention on International Commercial Arbitration, done at Panama, January 30, 1975; investment means every asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk. Forms that an investment may take include: (a) an enterprise;

(b) shares, stock and other forms of equity participation in an enterprise; (c) (d) (e) bonds, debentures, other debt instruments and loans;2, 3 futures, options and other derivatives; turnkey, construction, management, production, revenue-sharing and other similar contracts; intellectual property rights; licences, authorisations, permits and similar rights conferred pursuant to the Party's law;4 and concession,

(f) (g)

2

Some forms of debt, such as bonds, debentures, and long-term notes, are more likely to have the characteristics of an investment, while other forms of debt, such as claims to payment that are immediately due and result from the sale of goods or services, are less likely to have such characteristics. A loan issued by one Party to another Party is not an investment.

3

4

Whether a particular type of licence, authorisation, permit or similar instrument (including a concession to the extent that it has the nature of such an instrument) has the characteristics of an investment depends on such factors as the nature and extent of the rights that the holder has under the Party's law. Among such instruments that do not have the characteristics of an investment are those that do not create any rights protected under the Party's law. For greater certainty, the foregoing is without prejudice to whether any asset associated with such instruments has the characteristics of an investment.

9-2

(h)

other tangible or intangible, movable or immovable property, and related property rights, such as leases, mortgages, liens and pledges,

but investment does not mean an order or judgment entered in a judicial or administrative action. investment agreement means a written agreement5 that is concluded and takes effect after the date of entry into force of this Agreement6 between an authority at the central level of government7 of a Party and a covered investment or an investor of another Party and that creates an exchange of rights and obligations, binding on both parties under the law applicable under Article 9.25.2 (Governing Law), on which the covered investment or the investor relies in establishing or acquiring a covered investment other than the written agreement itself, and that grants rights to the covered investment or investor: (a) with respect to natural resources that a national authority controls, such as oil, natural gas, rare earth minerals, timber, gold, iron ore and other similar resources,8 including for their exploration, extraction, refining, transportation, distribution or sale;

5

"Written agreement" refers to an agreement in writing, negotiated and executed by both parties, whether in a single instrument or in multiple instruments. For greater certainty: (a) a unilateral act of an administrative or judicial authority, such as a permit, licence, authorisation, certificate, approval, or similar instrument issued by a Party in its regulatory capacity, or a subsidy or grant, or a decree, order or judgment, standing alone; and an administrative or judicial consent decree or order,

(b)

shall not be considered a written agreement.
6

For greater certainty, a written agreement that is concluded and takes effect after the entry into force of this Agreement does not include the renewal or extension of an agreement in accordance with the provisions of the original agreement, and on the same or substantially the same terms and conditions as the original agreement, which has been concluded and entered in force prior to the entry into force of this Agreement.

7

For the purposes of this definition, "authority at the central level of government" means, for unitary states, an authority at the ministerial level of government. Ministerial level of government means government departments, ministries or other similar authorities at the central level of government, but does not include: (a) a governmental agency or organ established by a Party's constitution or a particular legislation that has a separate legal personality from government departments, ministries or other similar authorities under a Party's law, unless the day to day operations of that agency or organ are directed or controlled by government departments, ministries or other similar authorities; or (b) a governmental agency or organ that acts exclusively with respect to a particular region or province. 8 For the avoidance of doubt, this subparagraph does not include an investment agreement with respect to land, water or radio spectrum.

to supply services on behalf of the Party for consumption by the general public for: power generation or distribution, water treatment or distribution, telecommunications, or other similar services supplied on behalf of the Party for consumption by the general public;9 or to undertake infrastructure projects, such as the construction of roads, bridges, canals, dams or pipelines or other similar projects; provided, however, that the infrastructure is not for the exclusive or predominant use and benefit of the government;

(c)

investment authorisation10 means an authorisation that the foreign investment authority of a Party11 grants to a covered investment or an investor of another Party; investor of a non-Party means, with respect to a Party, an investor that attempts to make,12 is making, or has made an investment in the territory of that Party, that is not an investor of a Party; investor of a Party means a Party, or a national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of another Party; LCIA Arbitration Rules means the arbitration rules of the London Court of International Arbitration;

9

For the avoidance of doubt, this subparagraph does not cover correctional services, healthcare services, education services, childcare services, welfare services or other similar social services.

10

For greater certainty, the following are not encompassed within this definition: (i) actions taken by a Party to enforce laws of general application, such as competition, environmental, health or other regulatory laws; (ii) non-discriminatory licensing regimes; and (iii) a Party's decision to grant to a covered investment or an investor of another Party a particular investment incentive or other benefit, that is not provided by a foreign investment authority in an investment authorisation.

For the purposes of this definition, "foreign investment authority" means, as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement: (a) for Australia, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia under Australia's foreign investment policy including the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975; (b) for Canada, the Minister of Industry, but only when issuing a notice under Section 21 or 22 of the Investment Canada Act; (c) for Mexico, the National Commission of Foreign Investments (Comisión Nacional de Inversiones Extranjeras); and (d) for New Zealand, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Fisheries or the Minister for Land Information, to the extent that they make a decision to grant consent under the Overseas Investment Act 2005.
12

11

For greater certainty, the Parties understand that, for the purposes of the definitions of "investor of a non-Party" and "investor of a Party", an investor "attempts to make" an investment when that investor has taken concrete action or actions to make an investment, such as channelling resources or capital in order to set up a business, or applying for a permit or licence.

9-4

negotiated restructuring means the restructuring or rescheduling of a debt instrument that has been effected through (a) a modification or amendment of that debt instrument, as provided for under its terms, or (b) a comprehensive debt exchange or other similar process in which the holders of no less than 75 per cent of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt under that debt instrument have consented to the debt exchange or other process; New York Convention means the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958; non-disputing Party means a Party that is not a party to an investment dispute; protected information means confidential business information or information that is privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure under a Party's law, including classified government information; respondent means the Party that is a party to an investment dispute; Secretary-General means the Secretary-General of ICSID; and UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules means the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.

Article 9.2: Scope 1. This Chapter shall apply to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to: (a) (b) (c) investors of another Party; covered investments; and with respect to Article 9.10 (Performance Requirements) and Article 9.16 (Investment and Environmental, Health and other Regulatory Objectives), all investments in the territory of that Party.

2. A Party's obligations under this Chapter shall apply to measures adopted or maintained by: (a) the central, regional or local governments or authorities of that Party; and

9-5

(b)

any person, including a state enterprise or any other body, when it exercises any governmental authority delegated to it by central, regional or local governments or authorities of that Party.13

3. For greater certainty, this Chapter shall not bind a Party in relation to an act or fact that took place or a situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party.

Article 9.3: Relation to Other Chapters 1. In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and another Chapter of this Agreement, the other Chapter shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. 2. A requirement of a Party that a service supplier of another Party post a bond or other form of financial security as a condition for the cross-border supply of a service does not of itself make this Chapter applicable to measures adopted or maintained by the Party relating to such cross-border supply of the service. This Chapter shall apply to measures adopted or maintained by the Party relating to the posted bond or financial security, to the extent that the bond or financial security is a covered investment. 3. This Chapter shall not apply to measures adopted or maintained by a Party to the extent that they are covered by Chapter 11 (Financial Services). Article 9.4: National Treatment14 1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory. 2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.
13

For greater certainty, governmental authority is delegated under the Party's law, including through a legislative grant or a government order, directive or other action transferring or authorising the exercise of governmental authority. For greater certainty, whether treatment is accorded in "like circumstances" under Article 9.4 (National Treatment) or Article 9.5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) depends on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the relevant treatment distinguishes between investors or investments on the basis of legitimate public welfare objectives.

14

9-6

3. For greater certainty, the treatment to be accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 means, with respect to a regional level of government, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that regional level of government to investors, and to investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a part.

Article 9.5: Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment 1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investors of any other Party or of any non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory. 2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to territory of investors of any other Party or of any non-Party establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, or other disposition of investments. treatment no less investments in its with respect to the operation, and sale

3. For greater certainty, the treatment referred to in this Article does not encompass international dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms, such as those included in Section B (Investor-State Dispute Settlement). Article 9.6: Minimum Standard of Treatment15 1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with applicable customary international law principles, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. 2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments. The concepts of "fair and equitable treatment" and "full protection and security" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights. The obligations in paragraph 1 to provide: (a) "fair and equitable treatment" includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world; and

15

Article 9.6 (Minimum Standard of Treatment) shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 9A (Customary International Law).

9-7

(b)

"full protection and security" requires each Party to provide the level of police protection required under customary international law.

3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article. 4. For greater certainty, the mere fact that a Party takes or fails to take an action that may be inconsistent with an investor's expectations does not constitute a breach of this Article, even if there is loss or damage to the covered investment as a result. 5. For greater certainty, the mere fact that a subsidy or grant has not been issued, renewed or maintained, or has been modified or reduced, by a Party, does not constitute a breach of this Article, even if there is loss or damage to the covered investment as a result.

Article 9.7: Treatment in Case of Armed Conflict or Civil Strife 1. Notwithstanding Article 9.12.6(b) (Non-Conforming Measures), each Party shall accord to investors of another Party and to covered investments nondiscriminatory treatment with respect to measures it adopts or maintains relating to losses suffered by investments in its territory owing to armed conflict or civil strife. 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, if an investor of a Party, in a situation referred to in paragraph 1, suffers a loss in the territory of another Party resulting from: (a) requisitioning of its covered investment or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities; or destruction of its covered investment or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities, which was not required by the necessity of the situation,

(b)

the latter Party shall provide the investor restitution, compensation or both, as appropriate, for that loss. 3. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to existing measures relating to subsidies or grants that would be inconsistent with Article 9.4 (National Treatment) but for Article 9.12.6(b) (Non-Conforming Measures).

9-8

Article 9.8: Expropriation and Compensation16 1.

Article 9.8 (Expropriation and Compensation) shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 9B (Expropriation) and is subject to Annex 9-C (Expropriation Relating to Land). For greater certainty, for the purposes of this Article, the term "public purpose" refers to a concept in customary international law. Domestic law may express this or a similar concept by using different terms, such as "public necessity", "public interest" or "public use".

For greater certainty, a Party's decision not to issue, renew or maintain a subsidy or grant, or decision to modify or reduce a subsidy or grant, (a) in the absence of any specific commitment under law or contract to issue, renew or maintain that subsidy or grant; or in accordance with any terms or conditions attached to the issuance, renewal, modification, reduction and maintenance of that subsidy or grant,

Each Party shall permit returns in kind relating to a covered investment to be made as authorised or specified in a written agreement between the Party and a covered investment or an investor of another Party. 4. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, a Party may prevent or delay a transfer through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its laws22 relating to: (a) (b) bankruptcy, insolvency or the protection of the rights of creditors; issuing, trading or dealing in securities, futures, options or derivatives; criminal or penal offences; financial reporting or record keeping of transfers when necessary to assist law enforcement or financial regulatory authorities; or ensuring compliance with orders or judgments in judicial or administrative proceedings.

For greater certainty, a condition for the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage referred to in paragraph 2 does not constitute a "requirement" or a "commitment or undertaking" for the purposes of paragraph 1. For the purposes of this Article, the term "technology of the Party or of a person of the Party" includes technology that is owned by the Party or a person of the Party, and technology for which the Party or a person of the Party holds an exclusive licence.

in regard to any licence contract in existence at the time the requirement is imposed or enforced, or any commitment or undertaking is enforced, or any future licence contract25 freely entered into between the investor and a person in its territory, provided that the requirement is imposed or the commitment or undertaking is enforced in a manner that constitutes direct interference with that licence contract by an exercise of nonjudicial governmental authority of a Party. For greater certainty, paragraph 1(i) does not apply when the licence contract is concluded between the investor and a Party. 2. No Party shall condition the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, or sale or other disposition of an investment of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party in its territory, on compliance with any requirement: (a) (b) to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content; to purchase, use or accord a preference to goods produced in its territory, or to purchase goods from persons in its territory; to relate in any way the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with the investment; or to restrict sales of goods or services in its territory that the investment produces or supplies by relating those sales in any way to the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange earnings. Nothing in paragraph 2 shall be construed to prevent a Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with an investment of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party in its territory, on compliance with a requirement to locate production, supply a service, train or employ workers, construct or expand particular facilities, or carry out research and development, in its territory.

(ii)

(c)

Paragraph 1(i) shall not apply if the requirement is imposed or the commitment or undertaking is enforced by a tribunal as equitable remuneration under the Party's copyright laws. Provided that such measures are not applied in an arbitrary or unjustifiable manner, or do not constitute a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, paragraphs 1(b), 1(c), 1(f), 2(a) and 2(b) shall not be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining measures, including environmental measures: (i) necessary to secure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with this Agreement; necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; or related to the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.

For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party, in connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, or sale or other disposition of an investment of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party in its territory, from imposing or enforcing a requirement, or enforcing a commitment or undertaking, to employ or train workers in its territory provided that the employment or training does not require the transfer of a particular technology, production process or other proprietary knowledge to a person in its territory. 5. For greater certainty, paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to any commitment, undertaking or requirement other than those set out in those paragraphs. 6. This Article does not preclude enforcement of any commitment, undertaking or requirement between private parties, if a Party did not impose or require the commitment, undertaking or requirement.

Article 9.11: Senior Management and Boards of Directors 1. No Party shall require that an enterprise of that Party that is a covered investment appoint to a senior management position a natural person of any particular nationality. 2. A Party may require that a majority of the board of directors, or any committee thereof, of an enterprise of that Party that is a covered investment, be of a particular nationality or resident in the territory of the Party, provided that the requirement does not materially impair the ability of the investor to exercise control over its investment.

If a Party considers that a non-conforming measure applied by a regional level of government of another Party, as referred to in paragraph 1(a)(ii), creates a material impediment to investment in relation to the former Party, it may request consultations with regard to that measure. These Parties shall enter into consultations with a view to exchanging information on the operation of the measure and to considering whether further steps are necessary and appropriate.30

29

With respect to Viet Nam, Annex 9-I (Non-Conforming Measures Ratchet Mechanism) applies.

(a) Article 9.4 (National Treatment) shall not apply to any measure that falls within an exception to, or derogation from, the obligations which are imposed by: (i) (ii) Article 18.8 (National Treatment); or Article 3 of the TRIPS Agreement, if the exception or derogation relates to matters not addressed by Chapter 18 (Intellectual Property).

9-17

covered investment but for the subrogation, and the investor shall be precluded from pursuing these rights to the extent of the subrogation.

Article 9.14: Special Formalities and Information Requirements 1. Nothing in Article 9.4 (National Treatment) shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining a measure that prescribes special formalities in connection with a covered investment, such as a residency requirement for registration or a requirement that a covered investment be legally constituted under the laws or regulations of the Party, provided that these formalities do not materially impair the protections afforded by the Party to investors of another Party and covered investments pursuant to this Chapter. 2. Notwithstanding Article 9.4 (National Treatment) and Article 9.5 (MostFavoured-Nation Treatment), a Party may require an investor of another Party or its covered investment to provide information concerning that investment solely for informational or statistical purposes. The Party shall protect such information that is confidential from any disclosure that would prejudice the competitive position of the investor or the covered investment. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a Party from otherwise obtaining or disclosing information in connection with the equitable and good faith application of its law.

Article 9.15: Denial of Benefits 1. A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of another Party that is an enterprise of that other Party and to investments of that investor if the enterprise: (a) is owned or controlled by a person of a non-Party or of the denying Party; and has no substantial business activities in the territory of any Party other than the denying Party.

(b)

2. A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of another Party that is an enterprise of that other Party and to investments of that investor if persons of a non-Party own or control the enterprise and the denying Party adopts or maintains measures with respect to the non-Party or a person of the non-Party that prohibit transactions with the enterprise or that would be violated or circumvented if the benefits of this Chapter were accorded to the enterprise or to its investments.

9-18

Article 9.16: Investment and Environmental, Health and other Regulatory Objectives Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental, health or other regulatory objectives.

9-24

that the place shall be in the territory of a State that is a party to the New York Convention. 2. A non-disputing Party may make oral and written submissions to the tribunal regarding the interpretation of this Agreement. 3. After consultation with the disputing parties, the tribunal may accept and consider written amicus curiae submissions regarding a matter of fact or law within the scope of the dispute that may assist the tribunal in evaluating the submissions and arguments of the disputing parties from a person or entity that is not a disputing party but has a significant interest in the arbitral proceedings.

Without prejudice to a tribunal's authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not within the competence of the tribunal, including an objection to the tribunal's jurisdiction, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favour of the claimant may be made under Article 9.29 (Awards) or that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. (a) An objection under this paragraph shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as possible after the tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial or, in the case of an amendment to the notice of arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the amendment. On receipt of an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a schedule for considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has established for considering any other preliminary question, and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor. In deciding an objection under this paragraph that a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favour of the claimant may be made under Article 9.29 (Awards), the tribunal shall assume to be true the claimant's factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration (or any amendment

thereof) and, in disputes brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the statement of claim referred to in the relevant article of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute. (d) The respondent does not waive any objection as to competence, including an objection to jurisdiction, or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 5.

5. In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 4 or any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence, including an objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's jurisdiction. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request. However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days. 6. When the tribunal decides a respondent's objection under paragraph 4 or 5, it may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant's claim or the respondent's objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment. 7. For greater certainty, if an investor of a Party submits a claim under this Section, including a claim alleging that a Party breached Article 9.6 (Minimum Standard of Treatment), the investor has the burden of proving all elements of its claims, consistent with general principles of international law applicable to international arbitration. 8. A respondent may not assert as a defence, counterclaim, right of set-off or for any other reason, that the claimant has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract. 9. A tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the tribunal's jurisdiction. A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of a measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 9.19 (Submission of a Claim to

9-26

Arbitration). For the purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation. 10. In any arbitration conducted under this Section, at the request of a disputing party, a tribunal shall, before issuing a decision or award on liability, transmit its proposed decision or award to the disputing parties. Within 60 days after the tribunal transmits its proposed decision or award, the disputing parties may submit written comments to the tribunal concerning any aspect of its proposed decision or award. The tribunal shall consider any comments and issue its decision or award no later than 45 days after the expiration of the 60 day comment period. 11. In the event that an appellate mechanism for reviewing awards rendered by investor-State dispute settlement tribunals is developed in the future under other institutional arrangements, the Parties shall consider whether awards rendered under Article 9.29 (Awards) should be subject to that appellate mechanism. The Parties shall strive to ensure that any such appellate mechanism they consider adopting provides for transparency of proceedings similar to the transparency provisions established in Article 9.24 (Transparency of Arbitral Proceedings).

Article 9.24: Transparency of Arbitral Proceedings 1. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 4, the respondent shall, after receiving the following documents, promptly transmit them to the non-disputing Parties and make them available to the public: (a) (b) (c) the notice of intent; the notice of arbitration; pleadings, memorials and briefs submitted to the tribunal by a disputing party and any written submissions submitted pursuant to Article 9.23.2 (Conduct of the Arbitration) and Article 9.23.3 and Article 9.28 (Consolidation); minutes or transcripts of hearings of the tribunal, if available; and orders, awards and decisions of the tribunal.

(d) (e)

2. The tribunal shall conduct hearings open to the public and shall determine, in consultation with the disputing parties, the appropriate logistical arrangements. If a disputing party intends to use information in a hearing that is designated as protected information or otherwise subject to paragraph 3 it shall so advise the tribunal. The tribunal shall make appropriate arrangements to protect such

9-27

information from disclosure which may include closing the hearing for the duration of the discussion of that information. 3. Nothing in this Section, including paragraph 4(d), requires a respondent to make available to the public or otherwise disclose during or after the arbitral proceedings, including the hearing, protected information, or to furnish or allow access to information that it may withhold in accordance with Article 29.2 (Security Exceptions) or Article 29.7 (Disclosure of Information).33 4. Any protected information that is submitted to the tribunal shall be protected from disclosure in accordance with the following procedures: (a) subject to subparagraph (d), neither the disputing parties nor the tribunal shall disclose to any non-disputing Party or to the public any protected information if the disputing party that provided the information clearly designates it in accordance with subparagraph (b); any disputing party claiming that certain information constitutes protected information shall clearly designate the information according to any schedule set by the tribunal; a disputing party shall, according to any schedule set by the tribunal, submit a redacted version of the document that does not contain the protected information. Only the redacted version shall be disclosed in accordance with paragraph 1; and the tribunal, subject to paragraph 3, shall decide any objection regarding the designation of information claimed to be protected information. If the tribunal determines that the information was not properly designated, the disputing party that submitted the information may: (i) withdraw all or part of its submission containing that information; or agree to resubmit complete and redacted documents with corrected designations in accordance with the tribunal's determination and subparagraph (c).

(b)

(c)

(d)

(ii)

In either case, the other disputing party shall, whenever necessary, resubmit complete and redacted documents which either remove the information withdrawn under subparagraph (d)(i) by the
33

For greater certainty, when a respondent chooses to disclose to the tribunal information that may be withheld in accordance with Article 29.2 (Security Exceptions) or Article 29.7 (Disclosure of Information), the respondent may still withhold that information from disclosure to the public.

9-28

disputing party that first submitted the information or redesignate the information consistent with the designation under subparagraph (d)(ii) of the disputing party that first submitted the information. 5. Nothing in this Section requires a respondent to withhold from the public information required to be disclosed by its laws. The respondent should endeavour to apply those laws in a manner sensitive to protecting from disclosure information that has been designated as protected information.

Article 9.25: Governing Law 1. Subject to paragraph 3, when a claim is submitted under Article 9.19.1(a)(i)(A) (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) or Article 9.19.1(b)(i)(A), the tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.34 2. Subject to paragraph 3 and the other provisions of this Section, when a claim is submitted under Article 9.19.1(a)(i)(B) (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration), Article 9.19.1(a)(i)(C), Article 9.19.1(b)(i)(B) or Article 9.19.1(b)(i)(C), the tribunal shall apply: (a) the rules of law applicable to the pertinent investment authorisation or specified in the pertinent investment authorisation or investment agreement, or as the disputing parties may agree otherwise; or if, in the pertinent investment agreement the rules of law have not been specified or otherwise agreed: (i) the law of the respondent, including its rules on the conflict of laws;35 and such rules of international law as may be applicable.

(b)

(ii)

3. A decision of the Commission on the interpretation of a provision of this Agreement under Article 27.2.2(f) (Functions of the Commission) shall be binding on a tribunal, and any decision or award issued by a tribunal must be consistent with that decision.

34

For greater certainty, this provision is without prejudice to any consideration of the domestic law of the respondent when it is relevant to the claim as a matter of fact. The "law of the respondent" means the law that a domestic court or tribunal of proper jurisdiction would apply in the same case. For greater certainty, the law of the respondent includes the relevant law governing the investment agreement, including law on damages, mitigation, interest and estoppel.

9-29

Article 9.26: Interpretation of Annexes 1. If a respondent asserts as a defence that the measure alleged to be a breach is within the scope of a non-conforming measure set out in Annex I or Annex II, the tribunal shall, on request of the respondent, request the interpretation of the Commission on the issue. The Commission shall submit in writing any decision on its interpretation under Article 27.2.2(f) (Functions of the Commission) to the tribunal within 90 days of delivery of the request. 2. A decision issued by the Commission under paragraph 1 shall be binding on the tribunal, and any decision or award issued by the tribunal must be consistent with that decision. If the Commission fails to issue such a decision within 90 days, the tribunal shall decide the issue.

Article 9.27: Expert Reports Without prejudice to the appointment of other kinds of experts when authorised by the applicable arbitration rules, a tribunal, on request of a disputing party or, unless the disputing parties disapprove, on its own initiative, may appoint one or more experts to report to it in writing on any factual issue concerning scientific matters raised by a disputing party in a proceeding, subject to any terms and conditions that the disputing parties may agree.

Article 9.28: Consolidation 1. If two or more claims have been submitted separately to arbitration under Article 9.19.1 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) and the claims have a question of law or fact in common and arise out of the same events or circumstances, any disputing party may seek a consolidation order in accordance with the agreement of all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order or the terms of paragraphs 2 through 10. 2. A disputing party that seeks a consolidation order under this Article shall deliver, in writing, a request to the Secretary-General and to all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order and shall specify in the request: (a) the names and addresses of all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order; the nature of the order sought; and the grounds on which the order is sought.

(b) (c)

9-30

3. Unless the Secretary-General finds within a period of 30 days after the date of receiving a request under paragraph 2 that the request is manifestly unfounded, a tribunal shall be established under this Article. 4. Unless all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order agree otherwise, a tribunal established under this Article shall comprise three arbitrators: (a) (b) (c) one arbitrator appointed by agreement of the claimants; one arbitrator appointed by the respondent; and the presiding arbitrator appointed by the Secretary-General, provided that the presiding arbitrator is not a national of the respondent or of a Party of any claimant.

5. If, within a period of 60 days after the date when the Secretary-General receives a request made under paragraph 2, the respondent fails or the claimants fail to appoint an arbitrator in accordance with paragraph 4, the SecretaryGeneral, on request of any disputing party sought to be covered by the order, shall appoint, in his or her discretion, the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet appointed. 6. If a tribunal established under this Article is satisfied that two or more claims that have been submitted to arbitration under Article 9.19.1 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) have a question of law or fact in common, and arise out of the same events or circumstances, the tribunal may, in the interest of fair and efficient resolution of the claims, and after hearing the disputing parties, by order: (a) assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine together, all or part of the claims; assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine one or more of the claims, the determination of which it believes would assist in the resolution of the others; or instruct a tribunal previously established under Article 9.22 (Selection of Arbitrators) to assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine together, all or part of the claims, provided that: (i) that tribunal, on request of a claimant that was not previously a disputing party before that tribunal, shall be reconstituted with its original members, except that the arbitrator for the claimants shall be appointed pursuant to paragraphs 4(a) and 5; and that tribunal shall decide whether a prior hearing shall be repeated.

(ii)

9-31

7. If a tribunal has been established under this Article, a claimant that has submitted a claim to arbitration under Article 9.19.1 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) and that has not been named in a request made under paragraph 2 may make a written request to the tribunal that it be included in any order made under paragraph 6. The request shall specify: (a) (b) (c) the name and address of the claimant; the nature of the order sought; and the grounds on which the order is sought.

The claimant shall deliver a copy of its request to the Secretary-General. 8. A tribunal established under this Article shall conduct its proceedings in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, except as modified by this Section. 9. A tribunal established under Article 9.22 (Selection of Arbitrators) shall not have jurisdiction to decide a claim, or a part of a claim, over which a tribunal established or instructed under this Article has assumed jurisdiction. 10. On the application of a disputing party, a tribunal established under this Article, pending its decision under paragraph 6, may order that the proceedings of a tribunal established under Article 9.22 (Selection of Arbitrators) be stayed, unless the latter tribunal has already adjourned its proceedings.

Article 9.29: Awards 1. When a tribunal makes a final award, the tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only: (a) (b) monetary damages and any applicable interest; and restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the respondent may pay monetary damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution.

2. For greater certainty, if an investor of a Party submits a claim to arbitration under Article 9.19.1(a) (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration), it may recover only for loss or damage that it has incurred in its capacity as an investor of a Party. 3. A tribunal may also award costs and attorney's fees incurred by the disputing parties in connection with the arbitral proceeding, and shall determine

9-32

how and by whom those costs and attorney's fees shall be paid, in accordance with this Section and the applicable arbitration rules. 4. For greater certainty, for claims alleging the breach of an obligation under Section A with respect to an attempt to make an investment, when an award is made in favour of the claimant, the only damages that may be awarded are those that the claimant has proven were sustained in the attempt to make the investment, provided that the claimant also proves that the breach was the proximate cause of those damages. If the tribunal determines such claims to be frivolous, the tribunal may award to the respondent reasonable costs and attorney's fees. 5. Subject to paragraph 1, if a claim is submitted to arbitration under Article 9.19.1(b) (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) and an award is made in favour of the enterprise: (a) an award of restitution of property shall provide that restitution be made to the enterprise; an award of monetary damages and any applicable interest shall provide that the sum be paid to the enterprise; and the award shall provide that it is made without prejudice to any right that any person may have under applicable domestic law with respect to the relief provided in the award.

(b)

(c)

6.

A tribunal shall not award punitive damages.

7. An award made by a tribunal shall have no binding force except between the disputing parties and in respect of the particular case. 8. Subject to paragraph 9 and the applicable review procedure for an interim award, a disputing party shall abide by and comply with an award without delay. 9. A disputing party shall not seek enforcement of a final award until: (a) in the case of a final award made under the ICSID Convention: (i) 120 days have elapsed from the date the award was rendered and no disputing party has requested revision or annulment of the award; or revision or annulment proceedings have been completed; and

(ii)

(b)

in the case of a final award under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, or the rules selected

9-33

pursuant to Article 9.19.4(d) (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration): (i) 90 days have elapsed from the date the award was rendered and no disputing party has commenced a proceeding to revise, set aside or annul the award; or a court has dismissed or allowed an application to revise, set aside or annul the award and there is no further appeal.

(ii)

10.

Each Party shall provide for the enforcement of an award in its territory.

11. If the respondent fails to abide by or comply with a final award, on delivery of a request by the Party of the claimant, a panel shall be established under Article 28.7 (Establishment of a Panel). The requesting Party may seek in those proceedings: (a) a determination that the failure to abide by or comply with the final award is inconsistent with the obligations of this Agreement; and in accordance with Article 28.17 (Initial Report), a recommendation that the respondent abide by or comply with the final award.

(b)

12. A disputing party may seek enforcement of an arbitration award under the ICSID Convention, the New York Convention or the Inter-American Convention regardless of whether proceedings have been taken under paragraph 11. 13. A claim that is submitted to arbitration under this Section shall be considered to arise out of a commercial relationship or transaction for the purposes of Article I of the New York Convention and Article I of the InterAmerican Convention.

Article 9.30: Service of Documents Delivery of notice and other documents to a Party shall be made to the place named for that Party in Annex 9-D (Service of Documents on a Party Under Section B). A Party shall promptly make publicly available and notify the other Parties of any change to the place referred to in that Annex.

ANNEX 9-A CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW

The Parties confirm their shared understanding that "customary international law" generally and as specifically referenced in Article 9.6 (Minimum Standard of Treatment) results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. The customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the investments of aliens.

9-35

ANNEX 9-B EXPROPRIATION

The Parties confirm their shared understanding that: 1. An action or a series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in an investment. 2. Article 9.8.1 (Expropriation and Compensation) addresses two situations. The first is direct expropriation, in which an investment is nationalised or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure. 3. The second situation addressed by Article 9.8.1 (Expropriation and Compensation) is indirect expropriation, in which an action or series of actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure. (a) The determination of whether an action or series of actions by a Party, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors: (i) the economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred; the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations;36 and the character of the government action.

(ii)

(iii) (b)

Non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as

36

For greater certainty, whether an investor's investment-backed expectations are reasonable depends, to the extent relevant, on factors such as whether the government provided the investor with binding written assurances and the nature and extent of governmental regulation or the potential for government regulation in the relevant sector.

9-36

public health,37 safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations, except in rare circumstances.

37

For greater certainty and without limiting the scope of this subparagraph, regulatory actions to protect public health include, among others, such measures with respect to the regulation, pricing and supply of, and reimbursement for, pharmaceuticals (including biological products), diagnostics, vaccines, medical devices, gene therapies and technologies, health-related aids and appliances and blood and blood-related products.

9-37

ANNEX 9-C EXPROPRIATION RELATING TO LAND

1. Notwithstanding the obligations under Article 9.8 (Expropriation and Compensation), where Singapore is the expropriating Party, any measure of direct expropriation relating to land shall be for a purpose and upon payment of compensation at market value, in accordance with the applicable domestic legislation38 and any subsequent amendments thereto relating to the amount of compensation where such amendments provide for the method of determination of the compensation which is no less favourable to the investor for its expropriated investment than such method of determination in the applicable domestic legislation as at the time of entry into force of this Agreement for Singapore. 2. Notwithstanding the obligations under Article 9.8 (Expropriation and Compensation), where Viet Nam is the expropriating Party, any measure of direct expropriation relating to land shall be: (i) for a purpose in accordance with the applicable domestic legislation;39 and (ii) upon payment of compensation equivalent to the market value, while recognising the applicable domestic legislation.

38

The applicable domestic legislation is the Land Acquisition Act (Cap. 152) as at the date of entry into force of this Agreement for Singapore. The applicable domestic legislation is Viet Nam's Land Law, Law No. 45/2013/QH13 and Decree 44/2014/ND-CP Regulating Land Prices, as at the date of entry into force of this Agreement for Viet Nam.

Such measures include, inter alia, the establishment of restrictions or limitations on current payments and transfers (capital movements) to or from Chile, as well as transactions related to them, such as requiring that deposits, investments or credits from or to a foreign country, be subject to a reserve requirement (encaje). 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the reserve requirements that the Central Bank of Chile can apply pursuant to Article 49 No. 2 of Law 18.840, shall not exceed 30 per cent of the amount transferred and shall not be imposed for a period which exceeds two years.

ANNEX 9-F DL 600

Chile 1. The obligations and commitments contained in this Chapter do not apply to Decree Law 600, Foreign Investment Statute (Decreto Ley 600, Estatuto de la Inversión Extranjera) (hereinafter referred to in this Annex as "DL 600"), or its successors, and to Law 18.657, Foreign Capital Investment Fund Law (Ley 18.657, Ley de Fondos de Inversión de Capital Extranjero), with respect to: (a) The right of the Foreign Investment Committee of Chile (Comité de Inversiones Extranjeras) or its successor to accept or reject applications to invest through an investment contract under DL 60041 and the right to regulate the terms and conditions of foreign investment under DL 600 and Law 18.657.

41

The authorisation and execution of an investment contract under DL 600 by an investor of a Party or a covered investment does not create any right on the part of the investor or the covered investment to engage in particular activities in Chile.

A.

Agreements with selected international arbitration clauses

1. An investor of a Party may not submit to arbitration a claim for breach of an investment agreement under Article 9.19.1(a)(i)(C) (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) or Article 9.19.1(b)(i)(C) if the investment agreement provides the respondent's consent for the investor to arbitrate the alleged breach of the investment agreement and further provides that: (a) a claim may be submitted for breach of the investment agreement under at least one of the following alternatives: (i) the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings, provided that both the respondent and the Party of the investor are parties to the ICSID Convention; the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, provided that either the respondent or the Party of the investor is a party to the ICSID Convention; the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; the ICC Arbitration Rules; or the LCIA Arbitration Rules; and

in the case of arbitration not under the ICSID Convention, the legal place of the arbitration shall be: (i) in the territory of a State that is party to the New York Convention; and outside the territory of the respondent.

(ii)

2. Notwithstanding Article 9.21.2(b) (Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party), if a claimant submits to arbitration a claim that the respondent has breached:

9-51

(a)

an obligation under Section A pursuant to Article 9.19.1(a)(i)(A) (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) or Article 9.19.1(b)(i)(A); or an investment authorisation pursuant to Article 9.19.1(a)(i)(B) (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) or Article 9.19.1(b)(i)(B),

(b)

the claimant's submission of a written waiver shall not preclude its right to initiate or continue an arbitration under an investment agreement, if that investment agreement meets the criteria in paragraph 1, with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 9.19 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration). 3. If a claimant: (a) submits to arbitration a claim that the respondent has breached an obligation under Section A pursuant to Article 9.19.1(a)(i)(A) (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) or Article 9.19.1(b)(i)(A) or an investment authorisation pursuant to Article 9.19.1(a)(i)(B) or Article 9.19.1(b)(i)(B); and submits a claim to arbitration under an investment agreement that meets the criteria in paragraph 1, and the claims have a question of law or fact in common and arise out of the same events or circumstances,

(b)

any disputing party may seek a consolidation order in accordance with the agreement of all the disputing parties sought to be covered by the order or the terms of paragraphs 2 through 10 of Article 9.28 (Consolidation).

B. Certain agreements between Peru and covered investments or investors45 1. Pursuant to Legislative Decrees 662 and 757, Peru may enter into agreements known as "stability agreements" with covered investments or investors of another Party. 2. As part of a stability agreement referred to in paragraph 1, Peru accords certain benefits to the covered investment or the investor that is a party to the agreement. These benefits typically include a commitment to maintain the

existing income tax regime applicable to such covered investment or investor during a specified period of time. 3. A stability agreement referred to in paragraph 1 may constitute one of multiple written instruments that make up an "investment agreement", as defined in Article 9.1 (Definitions).46 If that is the case, a breach of such a stability agreement by Peru may constitute a breach of the investment agreement of which it is a part. 4. If a stability agreement does not constitute one of multiple instruments that make up an "investment agreement", as defined in Article 9.1 (Definitions), a breach of such a stability agreement by Peru shall not constitute a breach of an investment agreement.

C.

Limitation of Mexico's consent to arbitration

1. Without prejudice to a claimant's right to submit other claims pursuant to Article 9.19 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration), Mexico does not consent to the submission of any claim to arbitration under Article 9.19.1(a)(i)(C) or 9.19.1(b)(i)(C) if the submission to arbitration of that claim would be inconsistent with the following laws with respect to the relevant acts of authority47: (a) (b) Hydrocarbons Law, Articles 20 and 21; Law on Public Works and Related Services, Article 98, paragraph 2; Public Private Partnerships Law, Article 139, paragraph 3; Law on Roads, Bridges, and Federal Motor Carriers, Article 80; Ports Law, Article 3, paragraph 2; Airports Law, Article 3, paragraph 2; Regulatory Law of the Railway Service, Article 4, paragraph 2;

For greater certainty, for multiple written instruments to make up an "investment agreement", as defined in Article 9.1 (Definitions), one or more of those instruments must grant rights to the covered investment or the investor as defined in subparagraph (a), (b) or (c) of that definition. A stability agreement may constitute one of multiple written instruments that make up an "investment agreement" even if the stability agreement is not itself the instrument in which such rights are granted. For greater certainty, the term "act of authority" includes omissions.

provided, however, that the application of the provisions referred to in subparagraphs (a) through (i) shall not be used as a disguised means to repudiate or breach the investment agreement. 2. If any law referred to in paragraph 1 is amended to permit the submission to arbitration of such a claim after the entry into force of this Agreement for Mexico, the limitation of Mexico's consent specified in paragraph 1 shall not apply with respect to that law.48

Specific Canadian entities under subpart (c) of definition

For Canada, authority at the central level of government includes entities listed under Schedule III of the Financial Administration Act (R.S.C. 1985, c. F11), and port or bridge authorities, that have concluded an investment agreement under subpart (c) of the definition of "investment agreement" only if the government directs or controls the day to day operations or activities of the entity or authority in carrying out its obligations under the investment agreement.

selling and marketing of air transport services; computer reservation system services; specialty air services; airport operation services; and ground handling services.

6. In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and a bilateral, plurilateral or multilateral air services agreement to which two or more Parties are party, the air services agreement shall prevail in determining the rights and obligations of those Parties that are party to that air services agreement. 7. If two or more Parties have the same obligations under this Agreement and a bilateral, plurilateral or multilateral air services agreement, those Parties may invoke the dispute settlement procedures of this Agreement only after any dispute settlement procedures in the other agreement have been exhausted. 8. If the Annex on Air Transport Services of GATS is amended, the Parties shall jointly review any new definitions with a view to aligning the definitions in this Agreement with those definitions, as appropriate. Article 10.3: National Treatment 2 1. Each Party shall accord to services and service suppliers of another Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own services and service suppliers. 2. For greater certainty, the treatment to be accorded by a Party under paragraph 1 means, with respect to a regional level of government, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that regional level of government to service suppliers of the Party of which it forms a part.

Article 10.4: Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment Each Party shall accord to services and service suppliers of another Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to services and service suppliers of any other Party or a non-Party.
For greater certainty, whether treatment is accorded in "like circumstances" under Article 10.3 (National Treatment) or Article 10.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) depends on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the relevant treatment distinguishes between services or service suppliers on the basis of legitimate public welfare objectives.

Subparagraph (a)(iii) does not cover measures of a Party which limit inputs for the supply of services.

(a)

any existing non-conforming measure that is maintained by a Party at: (i) the central level of government, as set out by that Party in its Schedule to Annex I; a regional level of government, as set out by that Party in its Schedule to Annex I; or a local level of government;

(ii)

(iii) (b)

the continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a); or an amendment to any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a), to the extent that the amendment does not decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before the amendment, with Article 10.3 (National Treatment), Article 10.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 10.5 (Market Access) or Article 10.6 (Local Presence). 4

These Parties shall enter into consultations with a view to exchanging information on the operation of the measure and to considering whether further steps are necessary and appropriate. 5

Article 10.8: Domestic Regulation 1. Each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application affecting trade in services are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner.

With respect to Viet Nam, Annex 10-C (Non-Conforming Measures Ratchet Mechanism) applies.

For greater certainty, a Party may request consultations with another Party regarding nonconforming measures applied by the central level of government, as referred to in subparagraph 1(a)(i).

10-6

2. With a view to ensuring that measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements do not constitute unnecessary barriers to trade in services, while recognising the right to regulate and to introduce new regulations on the supply of services in order to meet its policy objectives, each Party shall endeavour to ensure that any such measures that it adopts or maintains are: (a) based on objective and transparent criteria, such as competence and the ability to supply the service; and in the case of licensing procedures, not in themselves a restriction on the supply of the service.

(b)

3. In determining whether a Party is in conformity with its obligations under paragraph 2, account shall be taken of international standards of relevant international organisations applied by that Party. 6 4. If a Party requires authorisation for the supply of a service, it shall ensure that its competent authorities: (a) within a reasonable period of time after the submission of an application considered complete under its laws and regulations, inform the applicant of the decision concerning the application; to the extent practicable, establish an indicative timeframe for the processing of an application; if an application is rejected, to the extent practicable, inform the applicant of the reasons for the rejection, either directly or on request, as appropriate; on request of the applicant, provide, without undue delay, information concerning the status of the application; to the extent practicable, provide the applicant with the opportunity to correct minor errors and omissions in the application and endeavour to provide guidance on the additional information required; and if they deem appropriate, accept copies of documents that are authenticated in accordance with the Party's laws in place of original documents.

5. Each Party shall ensure that any authorisation fee charged by any of its competent authorities is reasonable, transparent and does not, in itself, restrict the supply of the relevant service. 7 6. If licensing or qualification requirements include the completion of an examination, each Party shall ensure that: (a) (b) the examination is scheduled at reasonable intervals; and a reasonable period of time is provided to enable interested persons to submit an application.

7. Each Party shall ensure that there are procedures in place domestically to assess the competency of professionals of another Party. 8. Paragraphs 1 through 7 shall not apply to the non-conforming aspects of measures that are not subject to the obligations under Article 10.3 (National Treatment) or Article 10.5 (Market Access) by reason of an entry in a Party's Schedule to Annex I, or to measures that are not subject to the obligations under Article 10.3 (National Treatment) or Article 10.5 (Market Access) by reason of an entry in a Party's Schedule to Annex II. 9. If the results of the negotiations related to paragraph 4 of Article VI of GATS, or the results of any similar negotiations undertaken in other multilateral fora in which the Parties participate, enter into effect, the Parties shall jointly review these results with a view to bringing them into effect, as appropriate, under this Agreement.

Article 10.9: Recognition 1. For the purposes of the fulfilment, in whole or in part, of a Party's standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing or certification of service suppliers, and subject to the requirements of paragraph 4, it may recognise the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licences or certifications granted, in the territory of another Party or a non-Party. That recognition, which may be achieved through harmonisation or otherwise, may be based on an agreement or arrangement with the Party or non-Party concerned, or may be accorded autonomously. 2. If a Party recognises, autonomously or by agreement or arrangement, the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licences or certifications granted, in the territory of another Party or a non-Party, nothing in Article 10.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) shall be construed to require the Party to

For the purposes of this paragraph, authorisation fees do not include fees for the use of natural resources, payments for auction, tendering or other non-discriminatory means of awarding concessions, or mandated contributions to universal service provision.

10-8

accord recognition to the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licences or certifications granted, in the territory of any other Party. 3. A Party that is a party to an agreement or arrangement of the type referred to in paragraph 1, whether existing or future, shall afford adequate opportunity to another Party, on request, to negotiate its accession to that agreement or arrangement, or to negotiate a comparable agreement or arrangement. If a Party accords recognition autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity to another Party to demonstrate that education, experience, licences or certifications obtained or requirements met in that other Party's territory should be recognised. 4. A Party shall not accord recognition in a manner that would constitute a means of discrimination between Parties or between Parties and non-Parties in the application of its standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing or certification of service suppliers, or a disguised restriction on trade in services. 5. As set out in Annex 10-A (Professional Services), the Parties shall endeavour to facilitate trade in professional services, including through the establishment of a Professional Services Working Group.

Article 10.10: Denial of Benefits 1. A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to a service supplier of another Party if the service supplier is an enterprise owned or controlled by persons of a non-Party, and the denying Party adopts or maintains measures with respect to the non-Party or a person of the non-Party that prohibit transactions with the enterprise or that would be violated or circumvented if the benefits of this Chapter were accorded to the enterprise. 2. A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to a service supplier of another Party if the service supplier is an enterprise owned or controlled by persons of a non-Party or by persons of the denying Party that has no substantial business activities in the territory of any Party other than the denying Party.

Article 10.11: Transparency 1. Each Party shall maintain or establish appropriate mechanisms for responding to inquiries from interested persons regarding its regulations that relate to the subject matter of this Chapter. 8 2. If a Party does not provide advance notice and opportunity for comment pursuant to Article 26.2.2 (Publication) with respect to regulations that relate to

The implementation of the obligation to maintain or establish appropriate mechanisms may need to take into account the resource and budget constraints of small administrative agencies.

the subject matter in this Chapter, it shall, to the extent practicable, provide in writing or otherwise notify interested persons of the reasons for not doing so. 3. To the extent possible, each Party shall allow reasonable time between publication of final regulations and the date when they enter into effect. Article 10.12: Payments and Transfers 9 1. Each Party shall permit all transfers and payments that relate to the crossborder supply of services to be made freely and without delay into and out of its territory. 2. Each Party shall permit transfers and payments that relate to the crossborder supply of services to be made in a freely usable currency at the market rate of exchange that prevails at the time of transfer. 3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Party may prevent or delay a transfer or payment through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its laws 10 that relate to: (a) (b) bankruptcy, insolvency or the protection of the rights of creditors; issuing, trading or dealing in securities, futures, options or derivatives; financial reporting or record keeping of transfers when necessary to assist law enforcement or financial regulatory authorities; criminal or penal offences; or ensuring compliance with orders or judgments in judicial or administrative proceedings.

ANNEX 10-A PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

General Provisions 1. Each Party shall consult with relevant bodies in its territory to seek to identify professional services when two or more Parties are mutually interested in establishing dialogue on issues that relate to the recognition of professional qualifications, licensing or registration. 2.

Each Party shall encourage its relevant bodies to take into account agreements that relate to professional services in the development of agreements on the recognition of professional qualifications, licensing and registration. 4. A Party may consider, if feasible, taking steps to implement a temporary or project specific licensing or registration regime based on a foreign supplier's home licence or recognised professional body membership, without the need for further written examination. That temporary or limited licence regime should not operate to prevent a foreign supplier from gaining a local licence once that supplier satisfies the applicable local licensing requirements.

Engineering and Architectural Services 5. Further to paragraph 3, the Parties recognise the work in APEC to promote the mutual recognition of professional competence in engineering and architecture, and the professional mobility of these professions, under the APEC Engineer and APEC Architect frameworks. 6.

A Party shall encourage its relevant bodies operating APEC Engineer or APEC Architect Registers to enter into mutual recognition arrangements with the relevant bodies of other Parties operating those registers.

10-11

Temporary Licensing or Registration of Engineers 8. Further to paragraph 4, in taking steps to implement a temporary or project-specific licensing or registration regime for engineers, a Party shall consult with its relevant professional bodies with respect to any recommendations for: (a) the development of procedures for the temporary licensing or registration of engineers of another Party to permit them to practise their engineering specialties in its territory; the development of model procedures for adoption by the competent authorities throughout its territory to facilitate the temporary licensing or registration of those engineers; the engineering specialties to which priority should be given in developing temporary licensing or registration procedures; and other matters relating to the temporary licensing or registration of engineers identified in the consultations.

Legal Services 9. The Parties recognise that transnational legal services that cover the laws of multiple jurisdictions play an essential role in facilitating trade and investment and in promoting economic growth and business confidence. 10. If a Party regulates or seeks to regulate foreign lawyers and transnational legal practice, the Party shall encourage its relevant bodies to consider, subject to its laws and regulations, whether or in what manner: (a) foreign lawyers may practise foreign law on the basis of their right to practise that law in their home jurisdiction; foreign lawyers may prepare for and appear in commercial arbitration, conciliation and mediation proceedings; local ethical, conduct and disciplinary standards are applied to foreign lawyers in a manner that is no more burdensome for foreign lawyers than the requirements imposed on domestic (host country) lawyers; alternatives for minimum residency requirements are provided for foreign lawyers, such as requirements that foreign lawyers disclose to clients their status as a foreign lawyer, or maintain professional

(g)

Professional Services Working Group 11. The Parties hereby establish a Professional Services Working Group (Working Group), composed of representatives of each Party, to facilitate the activities listed in paragraphs 1 through 4. 12. The Working Group shall liaise, as appropriate, to support the Parties' relevant professional and regulatory bodies in pursuing the activities listed in paragraphs 1 through 4.

ANNEX 10-B EXPRESS DELIVERY SERVICES

1. For the purposes of this Annex, express delivery services means the collection, transport and delivery of documents, printed matter, parcels, goods or other items, on an expedited basis, while tracking and maintaining control of these items throughout the supply of the service. Express delivery services do not include air transport services, services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority, or maritime transport services. 11 2. For the purposes of this Annex, postal monopoly means a measure maintained by a Party making a postal operator within the Party's territory the exclusive supplier of specified collection, transport and delivery services. 3. Each Party that maintains a postal monopoly shall define the scope of the monopoly on the basis of objective criteria, including quantitative criteria such as price or weight thresholds. 12 4. The Parties confirm their desire to maintain at least the level of market openness for express delivery services that each provides on the date of its signature of this Agreement. If a Party considers that another Party is not
11

For greater certainty, express delivery services does not include: (a) for Australia, services reserved for exclusive supply by Australia Post as set out in the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 and its subordinate legislation and regulations; (b) for Brunei Darussalam, reserved exclusive rights for collection and delivery of letters by the Postal Services Department as set out in the Post Office Act (Chapter 52 of the Laws of Brunei), the Guidelines to Application of License for the Provision of Local Express Letter Service (2000) and the Guidelines to Application of License for the Provision of International Express Letter Service (2000); (c) for Canada, services reserved for exclusive supply by Canada Post Corporation as set out in the Canada Post Corporation Act and its regulations; (d) for Japan, correspondence delivery services within the meaning of the Law Concerning Correspondence Delivery Provided by Private Operators (Law No. 99, 2002) other than special correspondence delivery services as set out in Article 2, paragraph 7 of the law; (e) for Malaysia, reserved exclusive rights for collection and delivery of letters by Pos Malaysia as provided for under the Postal Services Act 2012; (f) for Mexico, mail services reserved for exclusive supply by the Mexican Postal Service as set out in the Mexican Postal laws and regulations, as well as motor carrier freight transportation services, as set forth in Title III of the Roads, Bridges, and Federal Motor Carrier Transportation Law and its regulations; (g) for New Zealand, the fastpost service and equivalent priority domestic mail services; (h) for Singapore, postal services as set out in the Postal Services Act (Cap 237A, 2000 Rev Ed) and certain express letter services which are administered under the Postal Services (Class License) Regulations 2005; (i) for the United States, delivery of letters over post routes subject to 18 U.S.C. 1693­1699 and 39 U.S.C. 601­606, but does include delivery of letters subject to the exceptions therein; and (j) for Viet Nam, reserved services as set out in Viet Nam Postal Law and relevant legal documents.

For greater certainty, the Parties understand that the scope of Chile's postal monopoly is defined on the basis of objective criteria by Decree 5037 (1960) and the ability of suppliers to supply delivery services in Chile is not limited by this Decree.

12

10-15

maintaining that level of market openness, it may request consultations. The other Party shall afford adequate opportunity for consultations and, to the extent possible, provide information in response to inquiries regarding the level of market openness and any related matter. 5. No Party shall allow a supplier of services covered by a postal monopoly to cross-subsidise its own or any other competitive supplier's express delivery services with revenues derived from monopoly postal services. 13 6. Each Party shall ensure that any supplier of services covered by a postal monopoly does not abuse its monopoly position to act in the Party's territory in a manner inconsistent with the Party's commitments under Article 9.4 (National Treatment), Article 10.3 (National Treatment) or Article 10.5 (Market Access) with respect to the supply of express delivery services. 14 7. No Party shall: (a) require an express delivery service supplier of another Party, as a condition of authorisation or licensing, to supply a basic universal postal service; or assess fees or other charges exclusively on express delivery service suppliers for the purpose of funding the supply of another delivery service. 15

(b)

8. Each Party shall ensure that any authority responsible for regulating express delivery services is not accountable to any supplier of express delivery services, and that the decisions and procedures that the authority adopts are impartial, non-discriminatory and transparent with respect to all express delivery service suppliers in its territory.

In the case of Viet Nam, this obligation shall not apply until three years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement for it. During this period, if a Party considers that Viet Nam is allowing such cross-subsidisation, it may request consultations. Viet Nam shall afford adequate opportunity for consultations and, to the extent possible, shall provide information in response to inquiries regarding the cross-subsidisation. For greater certainty, a supplier of services covered by a postal monopoly that exercises a right or privilege incidental to or associated with its monopoly position in a manner that is consistent with the Party's commitments listed in this paragraph with respect to express delivery services is not acting in a manner inconsistent with this paragraph. This paragraph shall not be construed to prevent a Party from imposing non-discriminatory fees on delivery service suppliers on the basis of objective and reasonable criteria, or from assessing fees or other charges on the express delivery services of its own supplier of services covered by a postal monopoly.

4

For greater certainty, if an investor of a Party submits a claim to arbitration under Section B of Chapter 9 (Investment): (1) as referenced in Article 9.23.7 (Conduct of the Arbitration), the investor has the burden of proving all elements of its claims, consistent with general principles of international law applicable to international investment arbitration; (2) pursuant to Article 9.23.4, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favour of the claimant may be made under Article 9.29 (Awards); and (3) pursuant to Article 9.23.6, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection and, in determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant's claim or the respondent's objection was frivolous and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.

Article 11.3: National Treatment5 1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own investors, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments in financial institutions in its territory. 2. Each Party shall accord to financial institutions of another Party, and to investments of investors of another Party in financial institutions, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own financial institutions, and to investments of its own investors in financial institutions, in like circumstances, with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of financial institutions and investments. 3. For greater certainty, the treatment to be accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 means, with respect to a regional level of government, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that regional level of government to investors, financial institutions and investments of investors in financial institutions, of the Party of which it forms a part. 4. For the purposes of the national treatment obligations in Article 11.6.1 (Cross-Border Trade), a Party shall accord to cross-border financial service suppliers of another Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own financial service suppliers, in like circumstances, with respect to the supply of the relevant service.

Article 11.4: Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment 1. Each Party shall accord to: (a) investors of another Party, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to investors of any other Party or of a non-Party, in like circumstances;

5

For greater certainty, whether treatment is accorded in "like circumstances" under Article 11.3 (National Treatment) or Article 11.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) depends on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the relevant treatment distinguishes between investors, investments, financial institutions or financial service suppliers on the basis of legitimate public welfare objectives.

11-6

(b)

financial institutions of another Party, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to financial institutions of any other Party or of a non-Party, in like circumstances; investments of investors of another Party in financial institutions, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to investments of investors of any other Party or of a non-Party in financial institutions, in like circumstances; and cross-border financial service suppliers of another Party, treatment no less favourable than that it accords to cross-border financial service suppliers of any other Party or of a non-Party, in like circumstances.

Article 11.6: Cross-Border Trade 1.

Each Party shall permit persons located in its territory, and its nationals wherever located, to purchase financial services from cross-border financial service suppliers of another Party located in the territory of a Party other than the permitting Party. This obligation does not require a Party to permit those suppliers to do business or solicit in its territory. A Party may define "doing business" and "solicitation" for the purposes of this obligation provided that those definitions are not inconsistent with paragraph 1. 3. Without prejudice to other means of prudential regulation of cross-border trade in financial services, a Party may require the registration or authorisation of cross-border financial service suppliers of another Party and of financial instruments. Article 11.7: New Financial Services7 Each Party shall permit a financial institution of another Party to supply a new financial service that the Party would permit its own financial institutions, in like circumstances, to supply without adopting a law or modifying an existing law.8 Notwithstanding Article 11.5(b) (Market Access for Financial Institutions), a Party may determine the institutional and juridical form through which the new financial service may be supplied and may require authorisation for the supply of the service. If a Party requires a financial institution to obtain authorisation to supply a new financial service, the Party shall decide within a reasonable period
7

The Parties understand that nothing in this Article prevents a financial institution of a Party from applying to another Party to request that it authorise the supply of a financial service that is not supplied in the territory of any Party. That application shall be subject to the law of the Party to which the application is made and, for greater certainty, shall not be subject to this Article.
8

For greater certainty, a Party may issue a new regulation or other subordinate measure in permitting the supply of the new financial service.

11-8

of time whether to issue the authorisation and may refuse the authorisation only for prudential reasons.

Article 11.8: Treatment of Certain Information Nothing in this Chapter shall require a Party to furnish or allow access to: (a) information related to the financial affairs and accounts of individual customers of financial institutions or cross-border financial service suppliers; or any confidential information, the disclosure of which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest or prejudice legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises.

Article 11.3 (National Treatment), Article 11.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 11.5 (Market Access for Financial Institutions), Article 11.6 (Cross-Border Trade) and Article 11.9 (Senior Management and Boards of Directors) shall not apply to: (a) any existing non-conforming measure that is maintained by a Party at: (i) the central level of government, as set out by that Party in Section A of its Schedule to Annex III; a regional level of government, as set out by that Party in Section A of its Schedule to Annex III; or a local level of government;

the continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a); or an amendment to any non-conforming measure referred to in subparagraph (a) to the extent that the amendment does not decrease the conformity of the measure as it existed:9 (i) immediately before the amendment, with Article 11.3 (National Treatment), Article 11.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 11.5 (Market Access for Financial Institutions) or Article 11.9 (Senior Management and Boards of Directors); or on the date of entry into force of the Agreement for the Party applying the non-conforming measure, with Article 11.6 (Cross-Border Trade).

2. Article 11.3 (National Treatment), Article 11.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 11.5 (Market Access for Financial Institutions), Article 11.6 (Cross-Border Trade) and Article 11.9 (Senior Management and Boards of Directors) shall not apply to any measure that a Party adopts or maintains with respect to sectors, subsectors or activities, as set out by that Party in Section B of its Schedule to Annex III. 3. A non-conforming measure, set out in a Party's Schedule to Annex I or II as not subject to Article 9.4 (National Treatment), Article 9.5 (Most-FavouredNation Treatment), Article 9.11 (Senior Management and Boards of Directors), Article 10.3 (National Treatment) or Article 10.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), shall be treated as a non-conforming measure not subject to Article 11.3 (National Treatment), Article 11.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) or Article 11.9 (Senior Management and Boards of Directors), as the case may be, to the extent that the measure, sector, subsector or activity set out in the entry is covered by this Chapter. 4. (a) Article 11.3 (National Treatment) shall not apply to any measure that falls within an exception to, or derogation from, the obligations which are imposed by: (i) (ii) Article 18.8 (National Treatment); or Article 3 of the TRIPS Agreement, if the exception or derogation relates to matters not addressed by Chapter 18 (Intellectual Property).

With respect to Viet Nam, Annex 11-C (Non-Conforming Measures Ratchet Mechanism) applies.

11-10

(b)

Article 11.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) shall not apply to any measure that falls within Article 5 of the TRIPS Agreement, or an exception to, or derogation from, the obligations which are imposed by: (i) (ii) Article 18.8 (National Treatment); or Article 4 of the TRIPS Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Chapter and Agreement except for Chapter 2 (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods), Chapter 3 (Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures), Chapter 4 (Textiles and Apparel), Chapter 5 (Customs Administration and Trade Facilitation), Chapter 6 (Trade Remedies), Chapter 7 (Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures) and Chapter 8 (Technical Barriers to Trade), a Party shall not be prevented from adopting or maintaining measures for prudential reasons,10, 11 including for the protection of investors, depositors, policy holders, or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial institution or cross-border financial service supplier, or to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system. If these measures do not conform with the provisions of this Agreement to which this exception applies, they shall not be used as a means of avoiding the Party's commitments or obligations under those provisions. 2. Nothing in this Chapter, Chapter 9 (Investment), Chapter 10 (CrossBorder Trade in Services), Chapter 13 (Telecommunications) including specifically Article 13.24 (Relation to Other Chapters), or Chapter 14 (Electronic Commerce), shall apply to non-discriminatory measures of general application taken by any public entity in pursuit of monetary and related credit policies or exchange rate policies. This paragraph shall not affect a Party's obligations under Article 9.10 (Performance Requirements) with respect to measures covered by Chapter 9 (Investment), under Article 9.9 (Transfers) or Article 10.12 (Payments and Transfers).

10

The Parties understand that the term "prudential reasons" includes the maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity, or financial responsibility of individual financial institutions or crossborder financial service suppliers as well as the safety, and financial and operational integrity of payment and clearing systems. For greater certainty, if a measure challenged under Section B of Chapter 9 (Investment) is determined to have been adopted or maintained by a Party for prudential reasons in accordance with procedures in Article 11.22 (Investment Disputes in Financial Services), a tribunal shall find that the measure is not inconsistent with the Party's obligations in the Agreement and accordingly shall not award any damages with respect to that measure.

11

11-11

3. Notwithstanding Article 9.9 (Transfers) and Article 10.12 (Payments and Transfers), as incorporated into this Chapter, a Party may prevent or limit transfers by a financial institution or cross-border financial service supplier to, or for the benefit of, an affiliate of or person related to such institution or supplier, through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of measures relating to maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity, or financial responsibility of financial institutions or cross-border financial service suppliers. This paragraph does not prejudice any other provision of this Agreement that permits a Party to restrict transfers. 4. For greater certainty, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations that are not inconsistent with this Chapter, including those relating to the prevention of deceptive and fraudulent practices or to deal with the effects of a default on financial services contracts, subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between Parties or between Parties and non-Parties where like conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on investment in financial institutions or cross-border trade in financial services as covered by this Chapter.

Article 11.12: Recognition 1. A Party may recognise prudential measures of another Party or a nonParty in the application of measures covered by this Chapter.12 That recognition may be: (a) (b) (c) accorded autonomously; achieved through harmonisation or other means; or based upon an agreement or arrangement with another Party or a non-Party.

2. A Party that accords recognition of prudential measures under paragraph 1 shall provide adequate opportunity to another Party to demonstrate that circumstances exist in which there are or would be equivalent regulation, oversight, implementation of regulation and, if appropriate, procedures concerning the sharing of information between the relevant Parties. 3. If a Party accords recognition of prudential measures under paragraph 1(c) and the circumstances set out in paragraph 2 exist, that Party shall provide

12

For greater certainty, nothing in Article 11.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) shall be construed to require a Party to accord recognition to prudential measures of any other Party.

11-12

adequate opportunity to another Party to negotiate accession to the agreement or arrangement, or to negotiate a comparable agreement or arrangement.

Article 11.13: Transparency and Administration of Certain Measures 1. The Parties recognise that transparent regulations and policies governing the activities of financial institutions and cross-border financial service suppliers are important in facilitating their ability to gain access to and operate in each other's markets. Each Party commits to promote regulatory transparency in financial services. 2. Each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application to which this Chapter applies are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner. 3. Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Article 26.2 (Publication), shall not apply to regulations of general application relating to the subject matter of this Chapter. Each Party shall, to the extent practicable: (a) publish in advance any such regulation that it proposes to adopt and the purpose of the regulation; and provide interested persons and other Parties with a reasonable opportunity to comment on that proposed regulation.

(b)

4. At the time that it adopts a final regulation, a Party should, to the extent practicable, address in writing the substantive comments received from interested persons with respect to the proposed regulation.13 5. To the extent practicable, each Party should allow a reasonable period of time between publication of a final regulation of general application and the date when it enters into effect. 6. Each Party shall ensure that the rules of general application adopted or maintained by a self-regulatory organisation of the Party are promptly published or otherwise made available in a manner that enables interested persons to become acquainted with them. 7. Each Party shall maintain or establish appropriate mechanisms for responding to inquiries from interested persons regarding measures of general application covered by this Chapter.

13

For greater certainty, a Party may address those comments collectively on an official government website.

11-13

8. Each Party's regulatory authorities shall make publicly available the requirements, including any documentation required, for completing an application relating to the supply of financial services. 9. On request of an applicant, a Party's regulatory authority shall inform the applicant of the status of its application. If the authority requires additional information from the applicant, it shall notify the applicant without undue delay. 10. A Party's regulatory authority shall make an administrative decision on a complete application of an investor in a financial institution, a financial institution or a cross-border financial service supplier of another Party relating to the supply of a financial service, within 120 days and shall promptly notify the applicant of the decision. An application shall not be considered complete until all relevant hearings have been held and all necessary information has been received. If it is not practicable for a decision to be made within 120 days, the regulatory authority shall notify the applicant without undue delay and shall endeavour to make the decision within a reasonable period of time thereafter. 11. On request of an unsuccessful applicant, a regulatory authority that has denied an application shall, to the extent practicable, inform the applicant of the reasons for denial of the application.

Article 11.14: Self-Regulatory Organisations If a Party requires a financial institution or a cross-border financial service supplier of another Party to be a member of, participate in, or have access to, a self-regulatory organisation in order to provide a financial service in or into its territory, it shall ensure that the self-regulatory organisation observes the obligations contained in Article 11.3 (National Treatment) and Article 11.4 (MostFavoured-Nation Treatment).

Article 11.15: Payment and Clearing Systems Under terms and conditions that accord national treatment, each Party shall grant financial institutions of another Party established in its territory access to payment and clearing systems operated by public entities, and to official funding and refinancing facilities available in the normal course of ordinary business. This Article is not intended to confer access to the Party's lender of last resort facilities.

Article 11.16: Expedited Availability of Insurance Services The Parties recognise the importance of maintaining and developing regulatory procedures to expedite the offering of insurance services by licensed

11-14

suppliers. These procedures may include: allowing introduction of products unless those products are disapproved within a reasonable period of time; not requiring product approval or authorisation of insurance lines for insurance other than insurance sold to individuals or compulsory insurance; or not imposing limitations on the number or frequency of product introductions. If a Party maintains regulatory product approval procedures, that Party shall endeavour to maintain or improve those procedures.

Article 11.17: Performance of Back-Office Functions 1. The Parties recognise that the performance of the back-office functions of a financial institution in its territory by the head office or an affiliate of the financial institution, or by an unrelated service supplier, either inside or outside its territory, is important to the effective management and efficient operation of that financial institution. While a Party may require financial institutions to ensure compliance with any domestic requirements applicable to those functions, they recognise the importance of avoiding the imposition of arbitrary requirements on the performance of those functions. 2. For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 1 prevents a Party from requiring a financial institution in its territory to retain certain functions.

Article 11.18: Specific Commitments Annex 11-B (Specific commitments by each Party. Commitments) sets out certain specific

Article 11.19: Committee on Financial Services 1. The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Financial Services (Committee). The principal representative of each Party shall be an official of the Party's authority responsible for financial services set out in Annex 11-D (Authorities Responsible for Financial Services). 2. The Committee shall: (a) supervise the implementation of this Chapter and its further elaboration; consider issues regarding financial services that are referred to it by a Party; and participate in the dispute settlement procedures in accordance with Article 11.22 (Investment Disputes in Financial Services).

(b)

(c)

3. The Committee shall meet annually, or as it decides otherwise, to assess the functioning of this Agreement as it applies to financial services. The Committee shall inform the Commission of the results of any meeting.

Article 11.20: Consultations 1. A Party may request, in writing, consultations with another Party regarding any matter arising under this Agreement that affects financial services. The other Party shall give sympathetic consideration to the request to hold consultations. The consulting Parties shall report the results of their consultations to the Committee. 2. With regard to matters relating to existing non-conforming measures maintained by a Party at a regional level of government as referred to in Article 11.10.1(a)(ii) (Non-Conforming Measures): (a) A Party may request information on any non-conforming measure at the regional level of government of another Party. Each Party shall establish a contact point to respond to those requests and to facilitate the exchange of information regarding the operation of measures covered by those requests. If a Party considers that a non-conforming measure applied by a regional level of government of another Party creates a material impediment to trade or investment by a financial institution, an investor, investments in a financial institution or a cross-border financial service supplier, the Party may request consultations with regard to that measure. These Parties shall enter into consultations with a view to exchanging information on the operation of the measure and to considering whether further steps are necessary and appropriate.

(b)

3. Consultations under this Article shall include officials of the authorities specified in Annex 11-D (Authorities Responsible for Financial Services). 4. For greater certainty, nothing in this Article shall be construed to require a Party to derogate from its law regarding sharing of information between financial regulators or the requirements of an agreement or arrangement between financial authorities of the Parties, or to require a regulatory authority to take any action that would interfere with specific regulatory, supervisory, administrative or enforcement matters.

11-16

Article 11.21: Dispute Settlement 1. Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) shall apply as modified by this Article to the settlement of disputes arising under this Chapter. 2. If a Party claims that a dispute arises under this Chapter, Article 28.9 (Composition of Panels) shall apply, except that: (a) if the disputing Parties agree, each panellist shall meet the qualifications in paragraph 3; and in any other case: (i) each disputing Party shall select panellists that meet the qualifications set out in either paragraph 3 or Article 28.10.1 (Qualifications of Panellists); and if the responding Party invokes Article 11.11 (Exceptions), the chair of the panel shall meet the qualifications set out in paragraph 3, unless the disputing Parties otherwise agree.

(b)

(ii)

3. In addition to the requirements set out in Article 28.10.1(b) to (d) (Qualifications of Panellists), panellists in disputes arising under this Chapter shall have expertise or experience in financial services law or practice, which may include the regulation of financial institutions. 4. A Party may request the establishment of a panel pursuant to Article 11.22.2(c) (Investment Disputes in Financial Services) to consider whether and to what extent Article 11.11 (Exceptions) is a valid defence to a claim without having to request consultations under Article 28.5 (Consultations). The panel shall endeavour to present its initial report pursuant to Article 28.17 (Initial Report) within 150 days after the last panellist is appointed. 5. If a Party seeks to suspend benefits in the financial services sector, a panel that reconvenes to make a determination on the proposed suspension of benefits, in accordance with Article 28.20.5 (Non-Implementation ­ Compensation and Suspension of Benefits), shall seek the views of financial services experts, as necessary.

Article 11.22: Investment Disputes in Financial Services 1. If an investor of a Party submits a claim to arbitration under Section B of Chapter 9 (Investment) challenging a measure relating to regulation or supervision of financial institutions, markets or instruments, the expertise or experience of any

11-17

particular candidate with respect to financial services law or practice shall be taken into account in the appointment of arbitrators to the tribunal. 2. If an investor of a Party submits a claim to arbitration under Section B of Chapter 9 (Investment), and the respondent invokes Article 11.11 (Exceptions) as a defence, the following provisions of this Article shall apply. (a) The respondent shall, no later than the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial, or in the case of an amendment to the notice of arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the amendment, submit in writing to the authorities responsible for financial services of the Party of the claimant, as set out in Annex 11-D (Authorities Responsible for Financial Services), a request for a joint determination by the authorities of the respondent and the Party of the claimant on the issue of whether and to what extent Article 11.11 (Exceptions) is a valid defence to the claim. The respondent shall promptly provide the tribunal, if constituted, and the nondisputing Parties a copy of the request. The arbitration may proceed with respect to the claim only as provided in paragraph 4.14 The authorities of the respondent and the Party of the claimant shall attempt in good faith to make a determination as described in subparagraph (a). Any such determination shall be transmitted promptly to the disputing parties, the Committee and, if constituted, to the tribunal. The determination shall be binding on the tribunal and any decision or award issued by the tribunal must be consistent with that determination. If the authorities referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) have not made a determination within 120 days of the date of receipt of the respondent's written request for a determination under subparagraph (a), the respondent or the Party of the claimant may request the establishment of a panel under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) to consider whether and to what extent Article 11.11 (Exceptions) is a valid defence to the claim. The panel established under Article 28.7 (Establishment of a Panel) shall be constituted in accordance with Article 11.21 (Dispute Settlement). Further to

(b)

(c)

For the purposes of this Article, "joint determination" means a determination by the authorities responsible for financial services of the respondent and of the Party of the claimant, as set out in Annex 11-D (Authorities Responsible for Financial Services). If, within 14 days of the date of the receipt of a request for a joint determination, another Party provides a written notice to the respondent and the Party of the claimant indicating its substantial interest in the matter subject to the request, that other Party's authorities responsible for financial services may participate in discussions regarding the matter. The joint determination shall be made by the authorities responsible for financial services of the respondent and the Party of the claimant.

11-18

Article 28.18 (Final Report), the panel shall transmit its final report to the disputing Parties and to the tribunal. 3. The final report of a panel referred to in paragraph 2(c) shall be binding on the tribunal, and any decision or award issued by the tribunal must be consistent with the final report. 4. If no request for the establishment of a panel pursuant to paragraph 2(c) has been made within 10 days of the expiration of the 120 day period referred to in paragraph 2(c), the tribunal established under Article 9.19 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) may proceed with respect to the claim. (a) The tribunal shall draw no inference regarding the application of Article 11.11 (Exceptions) from the fact that the authorities have not made a determination as described in paragraphs 2(a), (b) and (c). The Party of the claimant may make oral and written submissions to the tribunal regarding the issue of whether and to what extent Article 11.11 (Exceptions) is a valid defence to the claim. Unless it makes such a submission, the Party of the claimant shall be presumed, for the purposes of the arbitration, to take a position on Article 11.11 that is not inconsistent with that of the respondent.

cooperating in multilateral fora to promote processing enhancements, such as those listed in subparagraphs (a) and (b).

Article 12.9: Relation to Other Chapters 1. Except for this Chapter, Chapter 1 (Initial Provisions and General Definitions), Chapter 27 (Administrative and Institutional Provisions), Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement), Chapter 30 (Final Provisions), Article 26.2 (Publication) and Article 26.5 (Provision of Information), no provision of this Agreement shall impose any obligation on a Party regarding its immigration measures. 2. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to impose obligations or commitments with respect to other Chapters of this Agreement.

Article 12.10: Dispute Settlement 1. No Party shall have recourse to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) regarding a refusal to grant temporary entry unless: (a) (b) the matter involves a pattern of practice; and the business persons affected have exhausted all available administrative remedies regarding the particular matter.

2. The remedies referred to in paragraph 1(b) shall be deemed to be exhausted if a final determination in the matter has not been issued by the other Party within a reasonable period of time after the date of the institution of proceedings for the remedy, including any proceedings for review or appeal, and the failure to issue such a determination is not attributable to delays caused by the business persons concerned.

(c)

4. Annex 13-A (Rural Telephone Suppliers ­ United States) and Annex 13-B (Rural Telephone Suppliers ­ Peru) include additional provisions relating to the scope of this Chapter.

Article 13.3: Approaches to Regulation 1. The Parties recognise the value of competitive markets to deliver a wide choice in the supply of telecommunications services and to enhance consumer welfare, and that economic regulation may not be needed if there is effective competition or if a service is new to a market. Accordingly, the Parties recognise that regulatory needs and approaches differ market by market, and that each Party may determine how to implement its obligations under this Chapter. 2. In this respect, the Parties recognise that a Party may: (a) engage in direct regulation either in anticipation of an issue that the Party expects may arise or to resolve an issue that has already arisen in the market; rely on the role of market forces, particularly with respect to market segments that are, or are likely to be, competitive or that have low barriers to entry, such as services provided by telecommunications suppliers that do not own network facilities;2 or

(b)

1

For greater certainty, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require a Party to authorise an enterprise of another Party to establish, construct, acquire, lease, operate or supply public telecommunications services, unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement.

Consistent with this subparagraph, the United States, based on its evaluation of the state of competition of the U.S. commercial mobile market, has not applied major supplier-related measures pursuant to Article 13.7 (Treatment by Major Suppliers of Public Telecommunications Services), Article 13.9.2 (Resale), Article 13.11 (Interconnection with Major Suppliers), Article 13.13 (Co-Location by Major Suppliers) or Article 13.14 (Access to Poles, Ducts, Conduits and Rights-of-Way Owned or Controlled by Major Suppliers) to the commercial mobile market.

13-4

(c)

use any other appropriate means that benefit the long-term interest of end-users.

3. When a Party engages in direct regulation, it may nonetheless forbear, to the extent provided for in its law, from applying that regulation to a service that the Party classifies as a public telecommunications service, if its telecommunications regulatory body or other competent body determines that: (a) enforcement of the regulation is not necessary to prevent unreasonable or discriminatory practices; enforcement of the regulation is not necessary for the protection of consumers; and forbearance is consistent with the public interest, including promoting and enhancing competition between suppliers of public telecommunications services.

(b)

(c)

Article 13.4: Access to and Use of Public Telecommunications Services3 1. Each Party shall ensure that any enterprise of another Party has access to and use of any public telecommunications service, including leased circuits, offered in its territory or across its borders, on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions. 2. Each Party shall ensure that any service supplier of another Party is permitted to: (a) purchase or lease, and attach terminal or other equipment that interfaces with a public telecommunications network; provide services to individual or multiple end-users over leased or owned circuits; connect leased or owned circuits with public telecommunications networks and services or with circuits leased or owned by another enterprise;4

(b)

(c)

3

For greater certainty, this Article does not prohibit any Party from requiring an enterprise to obtain a licence to supply any public telecommunications service within its territory.

In Viet Nam, networks authorised to establish for the purpose of carrying out, on a noncommercial basis, voice and data telecommunications between members of a closed user group can only directly interconnect with each other where approved in writing by the telecommunications regulatory body. Viet Nam shall ensure that upon request an applicant receives the reasons for the denial of an authorisation. Viet Nam shall review this requirement to obtain written approval within two years of the date of entry into force of this Agreement.

3. Each Party shall ensure that an enterprise of any Party may use public telecommunications services for the movement of information in its territory or across its borders, including for intra-corporate communications, and for access to information contained in databases or otherwise stored in machine-readable form in the territory of any Party. 4. Notwithstanding paragraph 3, a Party may take measures that are necessary to ensure the security and confidentiality of messages and to protect the privacy of personal data of end-users of public telecommunications networks or services, provided that those measures are not applied in a manner that would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade in services. 5. Each Party shall ensure that no condition is imposed on access to and use of public telecommunications networks and services, other than as necessary to: (a) safeguard the public service responsibilities of suppliers of public telecommunications networks and services, in particular their ability to make their networks or services generally available to the public; or protect the technical integrity of public telecommunications networks or services.

(b)

6. Provided that they satisfy the criteria set out in paragraph 5, conditions for access to and use of public telecommunications networks and services may include: (a) a requirement to use a specified technical interface, including an interface protocol, for connection with those networks or services; a requirement, when necessary, for the interoperability of those networks and services; type approval of terminal or other equipment that interfaces with the network and technical requirements relating to the attachment of that equipment to those networks; and a licensing, permit, registration or notification procedure which, if adopted or maintained, is transparent and provides for the processing of applications filed thereunder in accordance with a Party's laws or regulations.

Article 13.5: Obligations Relating to Suppliers of Public Telecommunications Services Interconnection5 1. Each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications services in its territory provide, directly or indirectly within the same territory, interconnection with suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party. 2. Each Party shall provide its telecommunications regulatory body with the authority to require interconnection at reasonable rates. 3. In carrying out paragraph 1, each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications services in its territory take reasonable steps to protect the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information of, or relating to, suppliers and end-users of public telecommunications services obtained as a result of interconnection arrangements and that those suppliers only use that information for the purpose of providing these services. Number Portability 4. Each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications services in its territory provide number portability without impairment to quality and reliability, on a timely basis, and on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions.6

5

For greater certainty, the term "interconnection", as used in this Chapter, does not include access to unbundled network elements. With respect to certain Parties, this paragraph shall apply as follows: (a) for Brunei Darussalam, this paragraph shall not apply until such time as it determines, pursuant to periodic review, that it is economically feasible to implement number portability in Brunei Darussalam; for Malaysia, this paragraph shall apply only with respect to commercial mobile services until such time as it determines that it is economically feasible to apply number portability to fixed services; and for Viet Nam, this paragraph shall apply to fixed services at such time as it determines that it is technically and economically feasible. Within four years of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for Viet Nam, it shall conduct a review for it to determine the economic feasibility of applying number portability to fixed services. With respect to commercial mobile services, this paragraph shall apply to Viet Nam no later than 2020.

Access to Numbers 5. Each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party established in its territory are afforded access to telephone numbers on a non-discriminatory basis.7

Article 13.6: International Mobile Roaming 1. The Parties shall endeavour to cooperate on promoting transparent and reasonable rates for international mobile roaming services that can help promote the growth of trade among the Parties and enhance consumer welfare. 2. A Party may choose to take steps to enhance transparency and competition with respect to international mobile roaming rates and technological alternatives to roaming services, such as: (a) ensuring that information regarding retail rates is easily accessible to consumers; and minimising impediments to the use of technological alternatives to roaming, whereby consumers when visiting the territory of a Party from the territory of another Party can access telecommunications services using the device of their choice.

(b)

3. The Parties recognise that a Party, when it has the authority to do so, may choose to adopt or maintain measures affecting rates for wholesale international roaming services with a view to ensuring that those rates are reasonable. If a Party considers it appropriate, it may cooperate on and implement mechanisms with other Parties to facilitate the implementation of those measures, including by entering into arrangements with those Parties. 4. If a Party (the first Party) chooses to regulate rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services, it shall ensure that a supplier of public telecommunications services of another Party (the second Party) has access to the regulated rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services for its customers roaming in the territory of the first Party in circumstances in which:8

7

For Viet Nam, this paragraph shall not apply with respect to blocks of numbers that have been allocated prior to entry into force of this Agreement.

For greater certainty, no Party shall, solely on the basis of any obligations owed to it by the first Party under a most-favoured-nation provision, or under a telecommunications-specific nondiscrimination provision, in any existing international trade agreement, seek or obtain for its suppliers the access to regulated rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services that is provided under this Article.

8

13-8

(a)

the second Party has entered into an arrangement with the first Party to reciprocally regulate rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services for suppliers of the two Parties;9 or in the absence of an arrangement of the type referred to in subparagraph (a), the supplier of public telecommunications services of the second Party, of its own accord: (i) makes available to suppliers of public telecommunications services of the first Party wholesale international mobile roaming services at rates or conditions that are reasonably comparable to the regulated rates or conditions;10 and meets any additional requirements 11 that the first Party imposes with respect to the availability of the regulated rates or conditions.

(b)

(ii)

The first Party may require suppliers of the second Party to fully utilise commercial negotiations to reach agreement on the terms for accessing such rates or conditions. 5. A Party that ensures access to regulated rates or conditions for wholesale international mobile roaming services in accordance with paragraph 4 shall be deemed to be in compliance with its obligations under Article 10.4 (MostFavoured-Nation Treatment), Article 13.4.1 (Access to and Use of Public Telecommunications Services), and Article 13.7 (Treatment by Major Suppliers of Public Telecommunications Services) with respect to international mobile roaming services. 6. Each Party shall provide to the other Parties information on rates for retail international mobile roaming services for voice, data and text messages offered to consumers of the Party when visiting the territories of the other Parties. A Party shall provide that information no later than one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement for the Party. Each Party shall update that information
9

For greater certainty, access under this subparagraph to the rates or conditions regulated by the first Party shall be available to a supplier of the second Party only if such regulated rates or conditions are reasonably comparable to those reciprocally regulated under the arrangement referred to in this subparagraph. The telecommunications regulatory body of the first Party shall, in the case of disagreement, determine whether the rates or conditions are reasonably comparable. For the purposes of this subparagraph, rates or conditions that are reasonably comparable means rates or conditions agreed to be such by the relevant suppliers or, in the case of disagreement, determined to be such by the telecommunications regulatory body of the first Party.

10

For greater certainty, such additional requirements may include, for example, that the rates provided to the supplier of the second Party reflect the reasonable cost of supplying international mobile roaming services by a supplier of the first Party to a supplier of the second Party, as determined through the methodology of the first Party.

11

13-9

and provide it to the other Parties on an annual basis or as otherwise agreed. Interested Parties shall endeavour to cooperate on compiling this information into a report to be mutually agreed by the Parties and to be made publicly available. 7. Nothing in this Article shall require a Party to regulate rates or conditions for international mobile roaming services.

Article 13.7: Treatment by Major Suppliers of Public Telecommunications Services Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory accords suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party treatment no less favourable than that major supplier accords in like circumstances to its subsidiaries, its affiliates or non-affiliated service suppliers regarding: (a) the availability, provisioning, rates or quality of like public telecommunications services; and the availability interconnection. of technical interfaces necessary for

(b)

Article 13.8: Competitive Safeguards 1. Each Party shall maintain appropriate measures for the purpose of preventing suppliers of public telecommunications services that, alone or together, are a major supplier in its territory from engaging in or continuing anticompetitive practices. 2. The anti-competitive practices referred to in paragraph 1 include in particular: (a) (b) engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidisation; using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results; and not making available, on a timely basis, to suppliers of public telecommunications services, technical information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information that are necessary for them to provide services.

(c)

Article 13.9: Resale 1. No Party shall prohibit the resale of any public telecommunications

13-10

service.12 2. Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory: (a) offers for resale, at reasonable rates 13 , to suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party, public telecommunications services that the major supplier provides at retail to end-users; and does not impose unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations on the resale of those services.14

(b)

3. Each Party may determine, in accordance with its laws and regulations, which public telecommunications services must be offered for resale by major suppliers pursuant to paragraph 2, based on the need to promote competition or to benefit the long-term interests of end-users. 4. If a Party does not require that a major supplier offer a specific public telecommunications service for resale, it nonetheless shall allow service suppliers to request that the service be offered for resale consistent with paragraph 2, without prejudice to the Party's decision on the request.

Article 13.10: Unbundling of Network Elements by Major Suppliers Each Party shall provide its telecommunications regulatory body or another appropriate body with the authority to require a major supplier in its territory to offer to public telecommunications service suppliers access to network elements on an unbundled basis on terms and conditions, and at cost-oriented rates, that are reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent for the supply of public telecommunications services. Each Party may determine the network elements required to be made available in its territory, and the suppliers that may obtain those elements, in accordance with its laws and regulations.

12

Brunei Darussalam may require that licensees who purchase public telecommunications services on a wholesale basis only resell their services to an end-user.

For the purposes of this Article, each Party may determine reasonable rates through any methodology it considers appropriate.
14

13

Where provided in its laws or regulations, a Party may prohibit a reseller that obtains, at wholesale rates, a public telecommunications service available at retail to only a limited category of subscribers from offering the service to a different category of subscribers.

13-11

Article 13.11: Interconnection with Major Suppliers General Terms and Conditions 1. Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides interconnection for the facilities and equipment of suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party: (a) (b) at any technically feasible point in the major supplier's network; under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards and specifications) and rates; of a quality no less favourable than that provided by the major supplier for its own like services, for like services of non-affiliated service suppliers, or for its subsidiaries or other affiliates; in a timely manner, on terms and conditions (including technical standards and specifications), and at cost-oriented rates, that are transparent, reasonable, having regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the suppliers do not have to pay for network components or facilities that they do not require for the service to be provided; and on request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to the majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of necessary additional facilities.

(c)

(d)

(e)

Options for Interconnecting with Major Suppliers 2. Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party with the opportunity to interconnect their facilities and equipment with those of the major supplier through the following options: (a) a reference interconnection offer or another standard interconnection offer containing the rates, terms and conditions that the major supplier offers generally to suppliers of public telecommunications services; or the terms and conditions of an interconnection agreement that is in effect.

(b)

3. In addition to the options provided in paragraph 2, each Party shall ensure that suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party have the opportunity to interconnect their facilities and equipment with those of the major supplier through the negotiation of a new interconnection agreement.

13-12

Public Availability of Interconnection Offers and Agreements 4. Each Party shall make publicly available the applicable procedures for interconnection negotiations with a major supplier in its territory. 5. Each Party shall provide means for suppliers of another Party to obtain the rates, terms and conditions necessary for interconnection offered by a major supplier. Those means include, at a minimum, ensuring: (a) the public availability of interconnection agreements that are in effect between a major supplier in its territory and other suppliers of public telecommunications services in its territory; the public availability of rates, terms and conditions for interconnection with a major supplier set by the telecommunications regulatory body or other competent body; or the public availability of a reference interconnection offer.

(b)

(c)

Services for which those rates, terms and conditions are made publicly available do not have to include all interconnection-related services offered by a major supplier, as determined by a Party under its laws and regulations.

Article 13.12: Provisioning and Pricing of Leased Circuits Services by Major Suppliers 1. Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides to service suppliers of another Party leased circuits services that are public telecommunications services in a reasonable period of time on terms and conditions, and at rates, that are reasonable and non-discriminatory, and based on a generally available offer. 2. Further to paragraph 1, each Party shall provide its telecommunications regulatory body or other appropriate bodies the authority to require a major supplier in its territory to offer leased circuits services that are public telecommunications services to service suppliers of another Party at capacitybased and cost-oriented prices.

Article 13.13: Co-Location by Major Suppliers 1. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3, each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides to suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party in the Party's territory physical co-location of equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements based on a generally

13-13

available offer, on a timely basis, and on terms and conditions and at cost-oriented rates, that are reasonable and non-discriminatory. 2. Where physical co-location is not practical for technical reasons or because of space limitations, each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides an alternative solution, such as facilitating virtual co-location, based on a generally available offer, on a timely basis, and on terms and conditions and at cost-oriented rates, that are reasonable and non-discriminatory. 3. A Party may determine, in accordance with its laws and regulations, which premises owned or controlled by major suppliers in its territory are subject to paragraphs 1 and 2. When the Party makes this determination, it shall take into account factors such as the state of competition in the market where co-location is required, whether those premises can be substituted in an economically or technically feasible manner in order to provide a competing service, or other specified public interest factors. 4. If a Party does not require that a major supplier offer co-location at certain premises, it nonetheless shall allow service suppliers to request that those premises be offered for co-location consistent with paragraph 1, without prejudice to the Party's decision on such a request.

Article 13.14: Access to Poles, Ducts, Conduits and Rights-of-way Owned or Controlled by Major Suppliers15 1. Each Party shall ensure that a major supplier in its territory provides access to poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way or any other structures as determined by the Party, owned or controlled by the major supplier, to suppliers of public telecommunications services of another Party in the Party's territory on a timely basis, on terms and conditions and at rates, that are reasonable, nondiscriminatory and transparent, subject to technical feasibility. 2. A Party may determine, in accordance with its laws and regulations, the poles, ducts, conduits, rights-of-way or any other structures to which it requires major suppliers in its territory to provide access in accordance with paragraph 1. When the Party makes this determination, it shall take into account factors such as the competitive effect of lack of such access, whether such structures can be substituted in an economically or technically feasible manner in order to provide a competing service, or other specified public interest factors.

Chile may comply with this obligation by maintaining appropriate measures for the purpose of preventing a major supplier in its territory from denying access to poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way, owned or controlled by the major supplier.

15

13-14

Article 13.15: International Submarine Cable Systems16, 17 Each Party shall ensure that any major supplier who controls international submarine cable landing stations in the Party's territory provides access to those landing stations, consistent with the provisions of Article 13.11 (Interconnection with Major Suppliers), Article 13.12 (Provisioning and Pricing of Leased Circuits Services by Major Suppliers) and Article 13.13 (Co-Location by Major Suppliers), to public telecommunications suppliers of another Party.

Article 13.16: Independent Regulatory Bodies and Government Ownership 1. Each Party shall ensure that its telecommunications regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of public telecommunications services. With a view to ensuring the independence and impartiality of telecommunications regulatory bodies, each Party shall ensure that its telecommunications regulatory body does not hold a financial interest 18 or maintain an operating or management role 19 in any supplier of public telecommunications services. 2. Each Party shall ensure that the regulatory decisions and procedures of its telecommunications regulatory body or other competent authority related to provisions contained in this Chapter are impartial with respect to all market participants. 3. No Party shall accord more favourable treatment to a supplier of telecommunications services in its territory than that accorded to a like service supplier of another Party on the basis that the supplier receiving more favourable treatment is owned by the national government of the Party.

For Chile, this provision shall apply when its telecommunications regulatory body obtains the authority to implement this provision. Nonetheless, Chile shall ensure reasonable and nondiscriminatory access to international submarine cable systems including landing stations in its territory. For Viet Nam, co-location for international submarine landing stations owned or controlled by the major supplier in the territory of Viet Nam excludes physical co-location. This paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit a government entity of a Party other than the telecommunications regulatory body from owning equity in a supplier of public telecommunications services. Viet Nam's telecommunications regulatory body assumes the role of representing the government as owner of certain telecommunications suppliers. In this context, Viet Nam shall comply with this provision by ensuring that any regulatory actions with respect to those suppliers do not materially disadvantage any competitor.

13-15

Article 13.17: Universal Service Each Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain. Each Party shall administer any universal service obligation that it maintains in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner, and shall ensure that its universal service obligation is not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service that it has defined.

Article 13.18: Licensing Process 1. If a Party requires a supplier of public telecommunications services to have a licence, the Party shall ensure the public availability of: (a) (b) all the licensing criteria and procedures that it applies; the period that it normally requires to reach a decision concerning an application for a licence; and the terms and conditions of all licences in effect.

(c)

2. Each Party shall ensure that, on request, an applicant receives the reasons for the: (a) (b) (c) (d) denial of a licence; imposition of supplier-specific conditions on a licence; revocation of a licence; or refusal to renew a licence.

Article 13.19: Allocation and Use of Scarce Resources 1. Each Party shall administer its procedures for the allocation and use of scarce telecommunications resources, including frequencies, numbers and rightsof-way, in an objective, timely, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. 2. Each Party shall make publicly available the current state of frequency bands allocated and assigned to specific suppliers20 but retains the right not to provide detailed identification of frequencies that are allocated or assigned for specific government uses. 3.
20

For greater certainty, a Party's measures allocating and assigning spectrum

For Peru, the commitment to make publicly available assigned bands shall apply only to bands used to provide access to end-users.

13-16

and managing frequency are not per se inconsistent with Article 10.5 (Market Access) either as it applies to cross-border trade in services or through the operation of Article 10.2.2 (Scope) to an investor or covered investment of another Party. Accordingly, each Party retains the right to establish and apply spectrum and frequency management policies that may have the effect of limiting the number of suppliers of public telecommunications services, provided that the Party does so in a manner that is consistent with other provisions of this Agreement. This includes the ability to allocate frequency bands, taking into account current and future needs and spectrum availability. 4. When making a spectrum allocation for commercial telecommunications services, each Party shall endeavour to rely on an open and transparent process that considers the public interest, including the promotion of competition. Each Party shall endeavour to rely generally on market-based approaches in assigning spectrum for terrestrial commercial telecommunications services. To this end, each Party shall have the authority to use mechanisms such as auctions, if appropriate, to assign spectrum for commercial use.

Article 13.20: Enforcement Each Party shall provide its competent authority with the authority to enforce the Party's measures relating to the obligations set out in Article 13.4 (Access to and Use of Public Telecommunications Services), Article 13.5 (Obligations Relating to Suppliers of Public Telecommunications Services), Article 13.7 (Treatment by Major Suppliers of Public Telecommunications Services), Article 13.8 (Competitive Safeguards), Article 13.9 (Resale), Article 13.10 (Unbundling of Network Elements by Major Suppliers), Article 13.11 (Interconnection with Major Suppliers), Article 13.12 (Provisioning and Pricing of Leased Circuits Services by Major Suppliers), Article 13.13 (Co-Location by Major Suppliers), Article 13.14 (Access to Poles, Ducts, Conduits and Rights-ofway Owned or Controlled by Major Suppliers) and Article 13.15 (International Submarine Cable Systems).

When conducting covered procurement by electronic means, a procuring entity shall: (a) ensure that the procurement is conducted using information technology systems and software, including those related to authentication and encryption of information, that are generally available and interoperable with other generally available information technology systems and software; and establish and maintain mechanisms that ensure the integrity of information provided by suppliers, including requests for participation and tenders.

(b)

Article 15.5: Transitional Measures 1. A Party that is a developing country (developing country Party) may, with the agreement of the other Parties, adopt or maintain one or more of the following transitional measures, during a transition period set out in, and in accordance with, Section J of the Party's Schedule to Annex 15-A: (a) a price preference programme, provided that the programme: (i) provides a preference only for the part of the tender incorporating goods or services originating in that developing country Party; and is transparent, and that the preference and its application in the procurement are clearly described in the notice of intended procurement;

(ii)

(b)

an offset, provided that any requirement for, or consideration of, the imposition of the offset is clearly stated in the notice of

15-7

intended procurement; (c) (d) the phased-in addition of specific entities or sectors; and a threshold that is higher than its permanent threshold.

A transitional measure shall be applied in a manner that does not discriminate between the other Parties. 2. The Parties may agree to the delayed application of any obligation in this Chapter, other than Article 15.4.1(b) (General Principles), by the developing country Party while that Party implements the obligation. The implementation period shall be only the period necessary to implement the obligation. 3. Any developing country Party that has negotiated an implementation period for an obligation under paragraph 2 shall list in its Schedule to Annex 15-A the agreed implementation period, the specific obligation subject to the implementation period and any interim obligation with which it has agreed to comply during the implementation period. 4. After this Agreement has entered into force for a developing country Party, the other Parties, on request of that developing country Party, may: (a) extend the transition period for a measure adopted or maintained under paragraph 1 or any implementation period negotiated under paragraph 2; or approve the adoption of a new transitional measure under paragraph 1, in special circumstances that were unforeseen.

(b)

5. A developing country Party that has negotiated a transitional measure under paragraphs 1 or 4, an implementation period under paragraph 2, or any extension under paragraph 4, shall take those steps during the transition period or implementation period that may be necessary to ensure that it is in compliance with this Chapter at the end of any such period. The developing country Party shall promptly notify the other Parties of each step in accordance with Article 27.7 (Reporting in relation to Party-specific Transition Periods). 6. Each Party shall give consideration to any request by a developing country Party for technical cooperation and capacity building in relation to that Party's implementation of this Chapter.

15-8

Article 15.6: Publication of Procurement Information 1. Each Party shall promptly publish any measure of general application relating to covered procurement, and any change or addition to this information. 2. Each Party shall list in Section I of its Schedule to Annex 15-A the paper or electronic means through which the Party publishes the information described in paragraph 1 and the notices required by Article 15.7 (Notices of Intended Procurement), Article 15.9.3 (Qualification of Suppliers) and Article 15.16.3 (Post-Award Information). 3. Each Party shall, on request, respond to an inquiry relating to the information referred to in paragraph 1.

Article 15.7: Notices of Intended Procurement 1. For each covered procurement, except in the circumstances described in Article 15.10 (Limited Tendering), a procuring entity shall publish a notice of intended procurement through the appropriate paper or electronic means listed in Annex 15-A. The notices shall remain readily accessible to the public until at least the expiration of the time period for responding to the notice or the deadline for submission of the tender. 2. The notices shall, if accessible by electronic means, be provided free of charge: (a) for central government entities that are covered under Annex 15-A, through a single point of access; and for sub-central government entities and other entities covered under Annex 15-A, through links in a single electronic portal.

(b)

3. Unless otherwise provided in this Chapter, each notice of intended procurement shall include the following information, unless that information is provided in the tender documentation that is made available free of charge to all interested suppliers at the same time as the notice of intended procurement: (a) the name and address of the procuring entity and other information necessary to contact the procuring entity and obtain all relevant documents relating to the procurement, and the cost and terms of payment to obtain the relevant documents, if any; a description of the procurement, including, if appropriate, the nature and quantity of the goods or services to be procured and a description of any options, or the estimated quantity if the quantity is not known;

(b)

15-9

(c)

if applicable, the time-frame for delivery of goods or services or the duration of the contract; if applicable, the address and any final date for the submission of requests for participation in the procurement; the address and the final date for the submission of tenders; the language or languages in which tenders or requests for participation may be submitted, if other than an official language of the Party of the procuring entity; a list and a brief description of any conditions for participation of suppliers, that may include any related requirements for specific documents or certifications that suppliers must provide; if, pursuant to Article 15.9 (Qualification of Suppliers), a procuring entity intends to select a limited number of qualified suppliers to be invited to tender, the criteria that will be used to select them and, if applicable, any limitation on the number of suppliers that will be permitted to tender; and an indication that the procurement is covered by this Chapter, unless that indication is publicly available through information published pursuant to Article 15.6.2 (Publication of Procurement Information).

(d)

(e) (f)

(g)

(h)

(i)

4. For greater certainty, paragraph 3 does not preclude a Party from charging a fee for tender documentation if the notice of intended procurement includes all of the information set out in paragraph 3. 5. For the purposes of this Chapter, each Party shall endeavour to use English as the language for publishing the notice of intended procurement. Notice of Planned Procurement 6. Procuring entities are encouraged to publish as early as possible in each fiscal year a notice regarding their future procurement plans (notice of planned procurement), which should include the subject matter of the procurement and the planned date of publication of the notice of intended procurement.

Article 15.8: Conditions for Participation 1. A procuring entity shall limit any conditions for participation in a covered procurement to those conditions that ensure that a supplier has the legal and

15-10

financial capacities and the commercial and technical abilities to fulfil the requirements of that procurement. 2. In establishing the conditions for participation, a procuring entity: (a) shall not impose the condition that, in order for a supplier to participate in a procurement, the supplier has previously been awarded one or more contracts by a procuring entity of a given Party or that the supplier has prior work experience in the territory of that Party; and may require relevant prior experience if essential to meet the requirements of the procurement.

(b)

3. In assessing whether a supplier satisfies the conditions for participation, a procuring entity shall: (a) evaluate the financial capacity and the commercial and technical abilities of a supplier on the basis of that supplier's business activities both inside and outside the territory of the Party of the procuring entity; and base its evaluation solely on the conditions that the procuring entity has specified in advance in notices or tender documentation.

(b)

4. If there is supporting material, a Party, including its procuring entities, may exclude a supplier on grounds such as: (a) (b) (c) bankruptcy or insolvency; false declarations; significant or persistent deficiencies in the performance of any substantive requirement or obligation under a prior contract or contracts; or failure to pay taxes.

(d)

5. For greater certainty, this Article is not intended to preclude a procuring entity from promoting compliance with laws in the territory in which the good is produced or the service is performed relating to labour rights as recognised by the Parties and set forth in Article 19.3 (Labour Rights), provided that such measures are applied in a manner consistent with Chapter 26 (Transparency and AntiCorruption), and are not applied in a manner that constitutes a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between the Parties or a disguised restriction on

15-11

trade between the Parties. 1

Article 15.9: Qualification of Suppliers Registration Systems and Qualification Procedures 1. A Party, including its procuring entities, may maintain a supplier registration system under which interested suppliers are required to register and provide certain information. 2. No Party, including its procuring entities, shall: (a) adopt or apply any registration system or qualification procedure with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to the participation of suppliers of another Party in its procurement; or use such registration system or qualification procedure to prevent or delay the inclusion of suppliers of other Parties on a list of suppliers or prevent those suppliers from being considered for a particular procurement.

(b)

Selective Tendering 3. If a Party's measures authorise the use of selective tendering, and if a procuring entity intends to use selective tendering, the procuring entity shall: (a) publish a notice of intended procurement that invites suppliers to submit a request for participation in a covered procurement; and include in the notice of intended procurement the information specified in Article 15.7.3(a), (b), (d), (g), (h) and (i) (Notices of Intended Procurement).

(b)

4.

The procuring entity shall: (a) publish the notice sufficiently in advance of the procurement to allow interested suppliers to request participation in the procurement; provide, by the commencement of the time period for tendering, at least the information in Article 15.7.3 (c), (e) and (f) (Notices of Intended Procurement) to the qualified suppliers that it notifies as specified in Article 15.14.3(b) (Time Periods); and

(b)

1

The adoption and maintenance of these measures by a Party should not be construed as evidence that another Party has breached the obligations under Chapter 19 (Labour) with respect to labour.

15-12

(c)

allow all qualified suppliers to submit a tender, unless the procuring entity stated in the notice of intended procurement a limitation on the number of suppliers that will be permitted to tender and the criteria or justification for selecting the limited number of suppliers.

5. If the tender documentation is not made publicly available from the date of publication of the notice referred to in paragraph 3, the procuring entity shall ensure that the tender documentation is made available at the same time to all the qualified suppliers selected in accordance with paragraph 4(c). Multi-Use Lists 6. A Party, including its procuring entities, may establish or maintain a multiuse list provided that it publishes annually, or otherwise makes continuously available by electronic means, a notice inviting interested suppliers to apply for inclusion on the list. The notice shall include: (a) a description of the goods and services, or categories thereof, for which the list may be used; the conditions for participation to be satisfied by suppliers for inclusion on the list and the methods that the procuring entity or other government agency will use to verify a supplier's satisfaction of those conditions; the name and address of the procuring entity or other government agency and other information necessary to contact the procuring entity and to obtain all relevant documents relating to the list; the period of validity of the list and the means for its renewal or termination or, if the period of validity is not provided, an indication of the method by which notice will be given of the termination of use of the list; the deadline for submission of applications for inclusion on the list, if applicable; and an indication that the list may be used for procurement covered by this Chapter, unless that indication is publicly available through information published pursuant to Article 15.6.2 (Publication of Procurement Information).

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

7. A Party, including its procuring entities, that establishes or maintains a multi-use list, shall include on the list, within a reasonable period of time, all suppliers that satisfy the conditions for participation set out in the notice referred to in paragraph 6.

15-13

8. If a supplier that is not included on a multi-use list submits a request for participation in a procurement based on the multi-use list and submits all required documents, within the time period provided for in Article 15.14.2 (Time Periods), a procuring entity shall examine the request. The procuring entity shall not exclude the supplier from consideration in respect of the procurement unless the procuring entity is not able to complete the examination of the request within the time period allowed for the submission of tenders. Information on Procuring Entity Decisions 9. A procuring entity or other entity of a Party shall promptly inform any supplier that submits a request for participation in a procurement or application for inclusion on a multi-use list of the decision with respect to the request or application. 10. If a procuring entity or other entity of a Party rejects a supplier's request for participation or application for inclusion on a multi-use list, ceases to recognise a supplier as qualified, or removes a supplier from a multi-use list, the entity shall promptly inform the supplier and on request of the supplier, promptly provide the supplier with a written explanation of the reason for its decision.

Article 15.10: Limited Tendering 1. Provided that it does not use this provision for the purpose of avoiding competition between suppliers, to protect domestic suppliers or in a manner that discriminates against suppliers of any other Party, a procuring entity may use limited tendering. 2. If a procuring entity uses limited tendering, it may choose, according to the nature of the procurement, not to apply Article 15.7 (Notices of Intended Procurement), Article 15.8 (Conditions for Participation), Article 15.9 (Qualification of Suppliers), Article 15.11 (Negotiations), Article 15.12 (Technical Specifications), Article 15.13 (Tender Documentation), Article 15.14 (Time Periods) or Article 15.15 (Treatment of Tenders and Awarding of Contracts). A procuring entity may use limited tendering only under the following circumstances: (a) if, in response to a prior notice, invitation to participate or invitation to tender: (i) no tenders were submitted or no suppliers requested participation; no tenders were submitted that conform to the essential requirements in the tender documentation;

(ii)

15-14

(iii) (iv)

no suppliers satisfied the conditions for participation; or the tenders submitted were collusive,

provided that the procuring entity does not substantially modify the essential requirements set out in the notices or tender documentation; (b) if the good or service can be supplied only by a particular supplier and no reasonable alternative or substitute good or service exists for any of the following reasons: (i) (ii) the requirement is for a work of art; the protection of patents, copyrights or other exclusive rights; or due to an absence of competition for technical reasons;

(iii) (c)

for additional deliveries by the original supplier or its authorised agents, of goods or services that were not included in the initial procurement if a change of supplier for such additional goods or services: (i) cannot be made for technical reasons such as requirements of interchangeability or interoperability with existing equipment, software, services or installations procured under the initial procurement, or due to conditions under original supplier warranties; and would cause significant inconvenience or substantial duplication of costs for the procuring entity;

(ii)

(d) (e)

for a good purchased on a commodity market or exchange; if a procuring entity procures a prototype or a first good or service that is intended for limited trial or that is developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment, study or original development. Original development of a prototype or a first good or service may include limited production or supply in order to incorporate the results of field testing and to demonstrate that the prototype or the first good or service is suitable for production or supply in quantity to acceptable quality standards, but does not include quantity production or supply to establish commercial viability or to recover research and development costs. Subsequent procurements of these newly developed goods or services, however, shall be subject

15-15

to this Chapter; (f) if additional construction services that were not included in the initial contract but that were within the objectives of the original tender documentation have, due to unforeseeable circumstances, become necessary to complete the construction services described therein. However, the total value of contracts awarded for additional construction services may not exceed 50 per cent of the value of the initial contract; for purchases made under exceptionally advantageous conditions that only arise in the very short term, such as from unusual disposals, liquidation, bankruptcy or receivership, but not for routine purchases from regular suppliers; if a contract is awarded to the winner of a design contest, provided that: (i) the contest has been organised in a manner that is consistent with this Chapter; and the contest is judged by an independent jury with a view to award a design contract to the winner; or

(g)

(h)

(ii)

(i)

in so far as is strictly necessary if, for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseeable by the procuring entity, the good or service could not be obtained in time by means of open or selective tendering.

3. For each contract awarded in accordance with paragraph 2, a procuring entity shall prepare a report in writing, or maintain a record, that includes the name of the procuring entity, the value and kind of good or service procured, and a statement that indicates the circumstances and conditions described in paragraph 2 that justified the use of limited tendering.

Article 15.11: Negotiations 1. A Party may provide for its procuring entities to conduct negotiations in the context of covered procurement if: (a) the procuring entity has indicated its intent to conduct negotiations in the notice of intended procurement required under Article 15.7 (Notices of Intended Procurement); or it appears from the evaluation that no tender is obviously the most advantageous in terms of the specific evaluation criteria set out in

(b)

15-16

the notice of intended procurement or tender documentation. 2. A procuring entity shall: (a) ensure that any elimination of suppliers participating in negotiations is carried out in accordance with the evaluation criteria set out in the notice of intended procurement or tender documentation; and when negotiations are concluded, provide a common deadline for the remaining participating suppliers to submit any new or revised tenders.

(b)

Article 15.12: Technical Specifications 1. A procuring entity shall not prepare, adopt or apply any technical specification or prescribe any conformity assessment procedure with the purpose or effect of creating an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the Parties. 2. In prescribing the technical specifications for the good or service being procured, a procuring entity shall, if appropriate: (a) set out the technical specifications in terms of performance and functional requirements, rather than design or descriptive characteristics; and base the technical specifications on international standards, if these exist; otherwise, on national technical regulations, recognised national standards or building codes.

(b)

3. A procuring entity shall not prescribe technical specifications that require or refer to a particular trademark or trade name, patent, copyright, design, type, specific origin, producer or supplier, unless there is no other sufficiently precise or intelligible way of describing the procurement requirements and provided that, in these cases, the procuring entity includes words such as "or equivalent" in the tender documentation. 4. A procuring entity shall not seek or accept, in a manner that would have the effect of precluding competition, advice that may be used in the preparation or adoption of any technical specification for a specific procurement from a person that may have a commercial interest in the procurement. 5. For greater certainty, a procuring entity may conduct market research in developing specifications for a particular procurement. 6. For greater certainty, this Article is not intended to preclude a procuring

15-17

entity from preparing, adopting or applying technical specifications to promote the conservation of natural resources or the protection of the environment. 7. For greater certainty, this Chapter is not intended to preclude a Party, or its procuring entities, from preparing, adopting or applying technical specifications required to protect sensitive government information, including specifications that may affect or limit the storage, hosting or processing of such information outside the territory of the Party. Article 15.13: Tender Documentation 1. A procuring entity shall promptly make available or provide on request to any interested supplier tender documentation that includes all information necessary to permit the supplier to prepare and submit a responsive tender. Unless already provided in the notice of intended procurement, that tender documentation shall include a complete description of: (a) the procurement, including the nature, scope and, if known, the quantity of the good or service to be procured or, if the quantity is not known, the estimated quantity and any requirements to be fulfilled, including any technical specifications, conformity certification, plans, drawings or instructional materials; any conditions for participation, including any financial guarantees, information and documents that suppliers are required to submit; all criteria to be considered in the awarding of the contract and the relative importance of those criteria; if there will be a public opening of tenders, the date, time and place for the opening; any other terms or conditions relevant to the evaluation of tenders; and any date for delivery of a good or supply of a service.

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

2. In establishing any date for the delivery of a good or the supply of a service being procured, a procuring entity shall take into account factors such as the complexity of the procurement. 3. A procuring entity shall promptly reply to any reasonable request for relevant information by an interested or participating supplier, provided that the information does not give that supplier an advantage over other suppliers.

15-18

Modifications 4. If, prior to the award of a contract, a procuring entity modifies the evaluation criteria or requirements set out in a notice of intended procurement or tender documentation provided to a participating supplier, or amends or re-issues a notice or tender documentation, it shall publish or provide those modifications, or the amended or re-issued notice or tender documentation: (a) to all suppliers that are participating in the procurement at the time of the modification, amendment or re-issuance, if those suppliers are known to the procuring entity, and in all other cases, in the same manner as the original information was made available; and in adequate time to allow those suppliers to modify and re-submit their initial tender, if appropriate.

(b)

Article 15.14: Time Periods General 1. A procuring entity shall, consistent with its own reasonable needs, provide sufficient time for a supplier to obtain the tender documentation and to prepare and submit a request for participation and a responsive tender, taking into account factors such as: (a) (b) the nature and complexity of the procurement; and the time necessary for transmitting tenders by non-electronic means from foreign as well as domestic points if electronic means are not used.

Deadlines 2. A procuring entity that uses selective tendering shall establish that the final date for the submission of a request for participation shall not, in principle, be less than 25 days from the date of publication of the notice of intended procurement. If a state of urgency duly substantiated by the procuring entity renders this time period impracticable, the time period may be reduced to no less than 10 days. 3. Except as provided in paragraphs 4 and 5, a procuring entity shall establish that the final date for the submission of tenders shall not be less than 40 days from the date on which: (a) in the case of open tendering, the notice of intended procurement is published; or

15-19

(b)

in the case of selective tendering, the procuring entity notifies the suppliers that they will be invited to submit tenders, whether or not it uses a multi-use list.

4. A procuring entity may reduce the time period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 by five days for each one of the following circumstances: (a) the notice of intended procurement is published by electronic means; the tender documentation is made available by electronic means from the date of the publication of the notice of intended procurement; and the procuring entity accepts tenders by electronic means.

(b)

(c)

5. A procuring entity may reduce the time period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 to no less than 10 days if: (a) the procuring entity has published a notice of planned procurement under Article 15.7 (Notices of Intended Procurement) at least 40 days and no more than 12 months in advance of the publication of the notice of intended procurement, and the notice of planned procurement contains: (i) (ii) a description of the procurement; the approximate final dates for the submission of tenders or requests for participation; the address from which documents relating to the procurement may be obtained; and as much of the information that is required for the notice of intended procurement as is available;

(iii)

(iv)

(b)

a state of urgency duly substantiated by the procuring entity renders impracticable the time period for tendering set out in paragraph 3; or the procuring entity procures commercial goods or services.

(c)

6. The use of paragraph 4, in conjunction with paragraph 5, shall in no case result in the reduction of the time periods for tendering set out in paragraph 3 to less than 10 days.

15-20

7. A procuring entity shall require all interested or participating suppliers to submit requests for participation or tenders in accordance with a common deadline. These time periods, and any extension of these time periods, shall be the same for all interested or participating suppliers.

Article 15.15: Treatment of Tenders and Awarding of Contracts Treatment of Tenders 1. A procuring entity shall receive, open and treat all tenders under procedures that guarantee the fairness and impartiality of the procurement process and the confidentiality of tenders. 2. If a procuring entity provides a supplier with an opportunity to correct unintentional errors of form between the opening of tenders and the awarding of the contract, the procuring entity shall provide the same opportunity to all participating suppliers. Awarding of Contracts 3. To be considered for an award, a tender shall be submitted in writing and shall, at the time of opening, comply with the essential requirements set out in the notice and tender documentation and be submitted by a supplier who satisfies the conditions for participation. 4. Unless a procuring entity determines that it is not in the public interest to award a contract, it shall award the contract to the supplier that the procuring entity has determined to be fully capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract and that, based solely on the evaluation criteria specified in the notice and tender documentation, submits: (a) (b) the most advantageous tender; or if price is the sole criterion, the lowest price.

5. A procuring entity shall not use options, cancel a covered procurement, or modify or terminate awarded contracts in order to avoid the obligations of this Chapter.

Article 15.16: Post-Award Information Information Provided to Suppliers 1. A procuring entity shall promptly inform suppliers that have submitted a tender of the contract award decision. The procuring entity may do so in writing

15-21

or through the prompt publication of the notice in paragraph 3, provided that the notice includes the date of award. If a supplier has requested the information in writing, the procuring entity shall provide it in writing. 2. Subject to Article 15.17 (Disclosure of Information), a procuring entity shall, on request, provide an unsuccessful supplier with an explanation of the reasons why the procuring entity did not select the unsuccessful supplier's tender or an explanation of the relative advantages of the successful supplier's tender. Publication of Award Information 3. A procuring entity shall, promptly after the award of a contract for a covered procurement, publish in an officially designated publication a notice containing at least the following information: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) a description of the good or service procured; the name and address of the procuring entity; the name and address of the successful supplier; the value of the contract award; the date of award or, if the procuring entity has already informed suppliers of the date of the award under paragraph 1, the contract date; and the procurement method used and, if a procedure was used pursuant to Article 15.10 (Limited Tendering), a brief description of the circumstances justifying the use of that procedure.

(f)

Maintenance of Records 4. A procuring entity shall maintain the documentation, records and reports relating to tendering procedures and contract awards for covered procurement, including the records and reports provided for in Article 15.10.3 (Limited Tendering), for at least three years after the award of a contract.

Article 15.17: Disclosure of Information Provision of Information to Parties 1. On request of any other Party, a Party shall provide promptly information sufficient to demonstrate whether a procurement was conducted fairly, impartially and in accordance with this Chapter, including, if applicable, information on the characteristics and relative advantages of the successful tender, without disclosing

15-22

confidential information. The Party that receives the information shall not disclose it to any supplier, except after consulting with, and obtaining the agreement of, the Party that provided the information. Non-Disclosure of Information 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, a Party, including its procuring entities, shall not, except to the extent required by law or with the written authorisation of the supplier that provided the information, disclose information that would prejudice legitimate commercial interests of a particular supplier or that might prejudice fair competition between suppliers. 3. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require a Party, including its procuring entities, authorities and review bodies, to disclose confidential information if that disclosure: (a) (b) (c) would impede law enforcement; might prejudice fair competition between suppliers; would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular persons, including the protection of intellectual property; or would otherwise be contrary to the public interest.

(d)

Article 15.18: Ensuring Integrity in Procurement Practices Each Party shall ensure that criminal or administrative measures exist to address corruption in its government procurement. These measures may include procedures to render ineligible for participation in the Party's procurements, either indefinitely or for a stated period of time, suppliers that the Party has determined to have engaged in fraudulent or other illegal actions in relation to government procurement in the Party's territory. Each Party shall also ensure that it has in place policies and procedures to eliminate to the extent possible or manage any potential conflict of interest on the part of those engaged in or having influence over a procurement.

Article 15.19: Domestic Review 1. Each Party shall maintain, establish or designate at least one impartial administrative or judicial authority (review authority) that is independent of its procuring entities to review, in a non-discriminatory, timely, transparent and effective manner, a challenge or complaint (complaint) by a supplier that there has been:

15-23

(a) (b)

a breach of this Chapter; or if the supplier does not have a right to directly challenge a breach of this Chapter under the law of a Party, a failure of a procuring entity to comply with the Party's measures implementing this Chapter,

arising in the context of a covered procurement, in which the supplier has, or had, an interest. The procedural rules for all complaints shall be in writing and made generally available. 2. In the event of a complaint by a supplier, arising in the context of covered procurement in which the supplier has, or had, an interest, that there has been a breach or a failure as referred to in paragraph 1, the Party of the procuring entity conducting the procurement shall encourage, if appropriate, the procuring entity and the supplier to seek resolution of the complaint through consultations. The procuring entity shall accord impartial and timely consideration to the complaint in a manner that is not prejudicial to the supplier's participation in ongoing or future procurement or to its right to seek corrective measures under the administrative or judicial review procedure. Each Party shall make information on its complaint mechanisms generally available. 3. If a body other than the review authority initially reviews a complaint, the Party shall ensure that the supplier may appeal the initial decision to the review authority that is independent of the procuring entity that is the subject of the complaint. 4. If the review authority has determined that there has been a breach or a failure as referred to in paragraph 1, a Party may limit compensation for the loss or damages suffered to either the costs reasonably incurred in the preparation of the tender or in bringing the complaint, or both. 5. Each Party shall ensure that, if the review authority is not a court, its review procedures are conducted in accordance with the following procedures: (a) a supplier shall be allowed sufficient time to prepare and submit a complaint in writing, which in no case shall be less than 10 days from the time when the basis of the complaint became known or reasonably should have become known to the supplier; a procuring entity shall respond in writing to a supplier's complaint and provide all relevant documents to the review authority; a supplier that initiates a complaint shall be provided an opportunity to reply to the procuring entity's response before the review authority takes a decision on the complaint; and

(b)

(c)

15-24

(d)

the review authority shall provide its decision on a supplier's complaint in a timely fashion, in writing, with an explanation of the basis for the decision.

6.

Each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures that provide for: (a) prompt interim measures, pending the resolution of a complaint, to preserve the supplier's opportunity to participate in the procurement and to ensure that the procuring entities of the Party comply with its measures implementing this Chapter; and corrective action that may include compensation under paragraph 4.

(b)

The procedures may provide that overriding adverse consequences for the interests concerned, including the public interest, may be taken into account when deciding whether those measures should be applied. Just cause for not acting shall be provided in writing.

Article 15.20: Modifications and Rectifications of Annex 1. A Party shall notify any proposed modification or rectification (modification) to its Schedule to Annex 15-A by circulating a notice in writing to the other Parties through the overall contact points designated under Article 27.5 (Contact Points). A Party shall provide compensatory adjustments for a change in coverage if necessary to maintain a level of coverage comparable to the coverage that existed prior to the modification. The Party may include the offer of compensatory adjustment in its notice. 2. A Party is not required to provide compensatory adjustments to the other Parties if the proposed modification concerns one of the following: (a) a procuring entity over which the Party has effectively eliminated its control or influence in respect of covered procurement by that procuring entity; or rectifications of a purely formal nature and minor modifications to its Schedule to Annex 15-A, such as: (i) (ii) changes in the name of a procuring entity; the merger of one or more procuring entities listed in its Schedule; the separation of a procuring entity listed in its Schedule into two or more procuring entities that are all added to the

(b)

(iii)

15-25

Article 16.1: Competition Law and Authorities and Anticompetitive Business Conduct1 1. Each Party shall adopt or maintain national competition laws that proscribe anticompetitive business conduct, with the objective of promoting economic efficiency and consumer welfare, and shall take appropriate action with respect to that conduct. These laws should take into account the APEC Principles to Enhance Competition and Regulatory Reform, done at Auckland, September 13, 1999. 2. Each Party shall endeavour to apply its national competition laws to all commercial activities in its territory.2 However, each Party may provide for certain exemptions from the application of its national competition laws provided that those exemptions are transparent and are based on public policy grounds or public interest grounds. 3. Each Party shall maintain an authority or authorities responsible for the enforcement of its national competition laws (national competition authorities). Each Party shall provide that it is the enforcement policy of that authority or authorities to act in accordance with the objectives set out in paragraph 1 and not to discriminate on the basis of nationality. Article 16.2: Procedural Fairness in Competition Law Enforcement3 1. Each Party shall ensure that before it imposes a sanction or remedy against a person for violating its national competition laws, it affords that person: (a) information about the national competition authority's competition concerns;

a reasonable opportunity to be represented by counsel; and a reasonable opportunity to be heard and present evidence in its defence, except that a Party may provide for the person to be heard and present evidence within a reasonable time after it imposes an interim sanction or remedy.

In particular, each Party shall afford that person a reasonable opportunity to present evidence or testimony in its defence, including: if applicable, to offer the analysis of a properly qualified expert, to cross-examine any testifying witness; and to review and rebut the evidence introduced in the enforcement proceeding4. 2. Each Party shall adopt or maintain written procedures pursuant to which its national competition law investigations are conducted. If these investigations are not subject to definitive deadlines, each Party's national competition authorities shall endeavour to conduct their investigations within a reasonable time frame. 3. Each Party shall adopt or maintain rules of procedure and evidence that apply to enforcement proceedings concerning alleged violations of its national competition laws and the determination of sanctions and remedies thereunder. These rules shall include procedures for introducing evidence, including expert evidence if applicable, and shall apply equally to all parties to a proceeding. 4. Each Party shall provide a person that is subject to the imposition of a sanction or remedy for violation of its national competition laws with the opportunity to seek review of the sanction or remedy, including review of alleged substantive or procedural errors, in a court or other independent tribunal established under that Party's laws. 5. Each Party shall authorise its national competition authorities to resolve alleged violations voluntarily by consent of the authority and the person subject to the enforcement action. A Party may provide for such voluntary resolution to be subject to judicial or independent tribunal approval or a public comment period before becoming final. 6. If a Party's national competition authority issues a public notice that reveals the existence of a pending or ongoing investigation, that authority shall avoid implying in that notice that the person referred to in that notice has engaged in the alleged conduct or violated the Party's national competition laws. 7. If a Party's national competition authority alleges a violation of its national competition laws, that authority shall be responsible for establishing the

legal and factual basis for the alleged violation in an enforcement proceeding.5 8.

If a Party's national competition authority uses or intends to use that information in an enforcement proceeding, the Party shall, if it is permissible under its law and as appropriate, provide a procedure to allow the person under investigation timely access to information that is necessary to prepare an adequate defence to the national competition authority's allegations. 9. Each Party shall ensure that its national competition authorities afford a person under investigation for possible violation of the national competition laws of that Party reasonable opportunity to consult with those competition authorities with respect to significant legal, factual or procedural issues that arise during the investigation.

Recognising that a private right of action is an important supplement to the public enforcement of national competition laws, each Party should adopt or maintain laws or other measures that provide an independent private right of action. 3. If a Party does not adopt or maintain laws or other measures that provide an independent private right of action, the Party shall adopt or maintain laws or other measures that provide a right that allows a person: (a) to request that the national competition authority initiate an investigation into an alleged violation of national competition laws; and to seek redress from a court or other independent tribunal following a finding of violation by the national competition

The Parties shall endeavour to cooperate and coordinate on the matters set out in this Article through the relevant national public bodies or officials responsible for consumer protection policy, laws or enforcement, as determined by each Party and compatible with their respective laws, regulations and important interests and within their reasonably available resources.

For greater certainty, the laws or regulations a Party adopts or maintains to proscribe these activities can be civil or criminal in nature.

On request of another Party, a Party shall make available to the requesting Party public information concerning: (a) (b) its competition law enforcement policies and practices; and exemptions and immunities to its national competition laws, provided that the request specifies the particular good or service and market of concern and includes information explaining how the exemption or immunity may hinder trade or investment between the Parties.

4.

No Party shall cause17 adverse effects to the interests of another Party through the use of non-commercial assistance that it provides, either directly or indirectly18, to any of its state-owned enterprises with respect to: (a) (b) the production and sale of a good by the state-owned enterprise; the supply of a service by the state-owned enterprise from the territory of the Party into the territory of another Party; or the supply of a service in the territory of another Party through an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of that other Party or any other Party.

(c)

2. Each Party shall ensure that its state enterprises and state-owned enterprises do not cause adverse effects to the interests of another Party through the use of noncommercial assistance that the state enterprise or state-owned enterprise provides to any of its state-owned enterprises with respect to: (a) (b) the production and sale of a good by the state-owned enterprise; the supply of a service by the state-owned enterprise from the territory of the Party into the territory of another Party; or the supply of a service in the territory of another Party through an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of that other Party or any other Party.

(c)

3. No Party shall cause injury to a domestic industry19 of another Party through the use of non-commercial assistance that it provides, either directly or indirectly, to any of its state-owned enterprises that is a covered investment in the territory of that other Party in circumstances where: (a) the non-commercial assistance is provided with respect to the production and sale of a good by the state-owned enterprise in the territory of the other Party; and

17

For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, it must be demonstrated that the adverse effects claimed have been caused by the non-commercial assistance. Thus, the non-commercial assistance must be examined within the context of other possible causal factors to ensure an appropriate attribution of causality.
18

For greater certainty, indirect provision includes the situation in which a Party entrusts or directs an enterprise that is not a state-owned enterprise to provide non-commercial assistance.
19

The term "domestic industry" refers to the domestic producers as a whole of the like good, or to those domestic producers whose collective output of the like good constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic production of the like good, excluding the state-owned enterprise that is a covered investment that has received the non-commercial assistance referred to in this paragraph.

17-9

(b)

a like good is produced and sold in the territory of the other Party by the domestic industry of that other Party.20

4. A service supplied by a state-owned enterprise of a Party within that Party's territory shall be deemed not to cause adverse effects.21

Article 17.7: Adverse Effects 1. For the purposes of Article 17.6.1 and Article 17.6.2 (Non-commercial Assistance), adverse effects arise if the effect of the non-commercial assistance is: (a) that the production and sale of a good by a Party's state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance displaces or impedes from the Party's market imports of a like good of another Party or sales of a like good produced by an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of the Party; that the production and sale of a good by a Party's state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance displaces or impedes from: (i) the market of another Party sales of a like good produced by an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of that other Party, or imports of a like good of any other Party; or the market of a non-Party imports of a like good of another Party;

(b)

(ii) (c)

a significant price undercutting by a good produced by a Party's stateowned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance and sold by the enterprise in: (i) the market of a Party as compared with the price in the same market of imports of a like good of another Party or a like good that is produced by an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of the Party, or significant price suppression, price depression or lost sales in the same market; or the market of a non-Party as compared with the price in the same market of imports of a like good of another Party, or significant price suppression, price depression or lost sales in the same market;

(ii)

20

In situations of material retardation of the establishment of a domestic industry, it is understood that a domestic industry may not yet produce and sell the like good. However, in these situations, there must be evidence that a prospective domestic producer has made a substantial commitment to commence production and sales of the like good.
21

For greater certainty, this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to a service that itself is a form of non-commercial assistance.

17-10

(d)

that services supplied by a Party's state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance displace or impede from the market of another Party a like service supplied by a service supplier of that other Party or any other Party; or a significant price undercutting by a service supplied in the market of another Party by a Party's state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance as compared with the price in the same market of a like service supplied by a service supplier of that other Party or any other Party, or significant price suppression, price depression or lost sales in the same market.22

(e)

2. For the purposes of paragraphs 1(a), 1(b) and 1(d), the displacing or impeding of a good or service includes any case in which it has been demonstrated that there has been a significant change in relative shares of the market to the disadvantage of the like good or like service. "Significant change in relative shares of the market" shall include any of the following situations: (a) there is a significant increase in the market share of the good or service of the Party's state-owned enterprise; the market share of the good or service of the Party's state-owned enterprise remains constant in circumstances in which, in the absence of the non-commercial assistance, it would have declined significantly; or the market share of the good or service of the Party's state-owned enterprise declines, but at a significantly slower rate than would have been the case in the absence of the non-commercial assistance.

(b)

(c)

The change must manifest itself over an appropriately representative period sufficient to demonstrate clear trends in the development of the market for the good or service concerned, which, in normal circumstances, shall be at least one year. 3. For the purposes of paragraphs 1(c) and 1(e), price undercutting shall include any case in which such price undercutting has been demonstrated through a comparison of the prices of the good or service of the state-owned enterprise with the prices of the like good or service. 4. Comparisons of the prices in paragraph 3 shall be made at the same level of trade and at comparable times, and due account shall be taken for factors affecting price comparability. If a direct comparison of transactions is not possible, the existence of price undercutting may be demonstrated on some other reasonable basis, such as, in the case of goods, a comparison of unit values. 5. Non-commercial assistance that a Party provides: (a)
22

before the signing of this Agreement; or

The purchase or sale of shares, stock or other forms of equity by a state-owned enterprise that has received non-commercial assistance as a means of its equity participation in another enterprise shall not be construed to give rise to adverse effects as provided for in Article 17.7.1 (Adverse Effects).

17-11

(b)

within three years after the signing of this Agreement, pursuant to a law that is enacted, or contractual obligation undertaken, prior to the signing of this Agreement,

shall be deemed not to cause adverse effects. 6. For the purposes of Article 17.6.1(b) and Article 17.6.2(b) (Non-commercial Assistance), the initial capitalisation of a state-owned enterprise, or the acquisition by a Party of a controlling interest in an enterprise, that is principally engaged in the supply of services within the territory of the Party, shall be deemed not to cause adverse effects.

Article 17.8: Injury 1. For the purposes of Article 17.6.3 (Non-commercial Assistance), the term "injury" shall be taken to mean material injury to a domestic industry, threat of material injury to a domestic industry or material retardation of the establishment of such an industry. A determination of material injury shall be based on positive evidence and involve an objective examination of the relevant factors, including the volume of production by the covered investment that has received non-commercial assistance, the effect of such production on prices for like goods produced and sold by the domestic industry, and the effect of such production on the domestic industry producing like goods.23 2. With regard to the volume of production by the covered investment that has received non-commercial assistance, consideration shall be given as to whether there has been a significant increase in the volume of production, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the territory of the Party in which injury is alleged to have occurred. With regard to the effect of the production by the covered investment on prices, consideration shall be given as to whether there has been a significant price undercutting by the goods produced and sold by the covered investment as compared with the price of like goods produced and sold by the domestic industry, or whether the effect of production by the covered investment is otherwise to depress prices to a significant degree or to prevent price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree. No one or several of these factors can necessarily give decisive guidance. 3. The examination of the impact on the domestic industry of the goods produced and sold by the covered investment that received the non-commercial assistance shall include an evaluation of all relevant economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the industry, such as actual and potential decline in output, sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investments, or utilisation of capacity; factors affecting domestic prices; actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital or investments and, in the case of agriculture, whether there has been an increased burden on government
23

The periods for examination of the non-commercial assistance and injury shall be reasonably established and shall end as closely as practical to the date of initiation of the proceeding before the panel.

17-12

support programmes. This list is not exhaustive, nor can one or several of these factors necessarily give decisive guidance. 4. It must be demonstrated that the goods produced and sold by the covered investment are, through the effects24 of the non-commercial assistance, causing injury within the meaning of this Article. The demonstration of a causal relationship between the goods produced and sold by the covered investment and the injury to the domestic industry shall be based on an examination of all relevant evidence. Any known factors other than the goods produced by the covered investment which at the same time are injuring the domestic industry shall be examined, and the injuries caused by these other factors must not be attributed to the goods produced and sold by the covered investment that has received non-commercial assistance. Factors which may be relevant in this respect include, among other things, the volumes and prices of other like goods in the market in question, contraction in demand or changes in the patterns of consumption, and developments in technology and the export performance and productivity of the domestic industry. 5. A determination of a threat of material injury shall be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility and shall be considered with special care. The change in circumstances which would create a situation in which noncommercial assistance to the covered investment would cause injury must be clearly foreseen and imminent. In making a determination regarding the existence of a threat of material injury, there should be consideration of relevant factors 25 and of whether the totality of the factors considered lead to the conclusion that further availability of goods produced by the covered investment is imminent and that, unless protective action is taken, material injury would occur.

24

As set out in paragraphs 2 and 3.

25

In making a determination regarding the existence of a threat of material injury, a panel pursuant to Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) should consider, among other things, such factors as: (a) the nature of the non-commercial assistance in question and the trade effects likely to arise therefrom; (b) a significant rate of increase in sales in the domestic market by the covered investment, indicating a likelihood of substantially increased sales; (c) sufficient freely disposable, or an imminent, substantial increase in, capacity of the covered investment indicating the likelihood of substantially increased production of the good by that covered investment, taking into account the availability of export markets to absorb additional production; (d) whether prices of goods sold by the covered investment will have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on the price of like goods; and (e) inventories of like goods.

ANNEX 17-A THRESHOLD CALCULATION

1. On the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the threshold referred to in Article 17.13.5 (Exceptions) shall be 200 million Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). 2. The amount of the threshold shall be adjusted at three-year intervals with each adjustment taking effect on 1 January. The first adjustment shall take place on the first 1 January following the entry into force of this Agreement, in accordance with the formula set out in this Annex. 3. The threshold shall be adjusted for changes in general price levels using a composite SDR inflation rate, calculated as a weighted sum of cumulative per cent changes in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflators of SDR component currencies over the three-year period ending 30 June of the year prior to the adjustment taking effect, and using the following formula: 1 = (1 + ( w .  ))0 where: 0 = threshold value at base period; 1 = new (adjusted) threshold value;  w = respective (fixed) weights of each currency,  , in the SDR (as at 30 June of the year prior to adjustment taking effect); and  = cumulative per cent change in the GDP deflator of each currency,  , in the SDR over the three-year period ending 30 June of the year prior to adjustment taking effect. 4. Each Party shall convert the threshold into national currency terms where the conversion rates shall be the average of monthly values of that Party's national currency in SDR terms over the three-year period to 30 June of the year before the threshold is to take effect. Each Party shall notify the other Parties of their applicable threshold in their respective national currencies. 5. For the purposes of this Chapter, all data shall be drawn from the International Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics database. 6. The Parties shall consult if a major change in a national currency vis-à-vis the SDR were to create a significant problem with regard to the application of this Chapter.

17-21

ANNEX 17-B PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING INFORMATION CONCERNING STATEOWNED ENTERPRISES AND DESIGNATED MONOPOLIES

1. If a panel has been established pursuant to Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) to examine a complaint arising under Article 17.4 (Non-discriminatory Treatment and Commercial Considerations) or Article 17.6 (Non-commercial Assistance), the disputing Parties may exchange written questions and responses, as set forth in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, to obtain information relevant to the complaint that is not otherwise readily available. 2. A disputing Party (questioning Party) may provide written questions to another disputing Party (answering Party) within 15 days of the date the panel is established. The answering Party shall provide its responses to the questions to the questioning Party within 30 days of the date it receives the questions. 3. The questioning Party may provide any follow-up written questions to the answering Party within 15 days of the date it receives the responses to the initial questions. The answering Party shall provide its responses to the follow-up questions to the questioning Party within 30 days of the date it receives the follow-up questions. 4. If the questioning Party considers that the answering Party has failed to cooperate in the information-gathering process under this Annex, the questioning Party shall inform the panel and the answering Party in writing within 30 days of the date the responses to the questioning Party's final questions are due, and provide the basis for its view. The panel shall afford the answering Party an opportunity to reply in writing. 5. A disputing Party that provides written questions or responses to another disputing Party pursuant to these procedures shall, on the same day, provide the questions or answers to the panel. In the event that a panel has not yet been composed, each disputing Party shall, upon the composition of the panel, promptly provide the panel with any questions or responses it has provided to the other disputing Party. 6. The answering Party may designate information in its responses as confidential information in accordance with the procedures set out in the Rules of Procedure established under Article 27.2.1(f) (Functions of the Commission) or other rules of procedure agreed to by the disputing Parties. 7. The time periods in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 may be modified upon agreement of the disputing Parties or approval by the panel. 8. In determining whether a disputing Party has failed to cooperate in the information-gathering process, the panel shall take into account the reasonableness of the questions and the efforts the answering Party has made to respond to the questions in a cooperative and timely manner.

17-22

9. In making findings of fact and its initial report, the panel should draw adverse inferences from instances of non-cooperation by a disputing Party in the informationgathering process. 10. The panel may deviate from the time period set out in Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) for the issuance of the initial report if necessary to accommodate the information-gathering process. 11. The panel may seek additional information from a disputing Party that was not provided to the panel through the information-gathering process where the panel considers the information necessary to resolve the dispute. However, the panel shall not request additional information to complete the record where the information would support a Party's position and the absence of that information in the record is the result of that Party's non-cooperation in the information-gathering process.

17-23

ANNEX 17-C FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS

Within five years of the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the Parties shall conduct further negotiations on extending the application of: (a) the disciplines in this Chapter to the activities of state-owned enterprises that are owned or controlled by a sub-central level of government, and designated monopolies designated by a sub-central level of government, where such activities have been listed in Annex 17-D (Application to Sub-Central State-Owned Enterprises and Designated Monopolies); and the disciplines in Article 17.6 (Non-commercial Assistance) and Article 17.7 (Adverse Effects) to address effects caused, in a market of a nonParty, by the supply of services by a state-owned enterprise.

Each Party shall also provide that signs that may serve as geographical indications are capable of protection under its trademark system.10 Article 18.20: Use of Identical or Similar Signs Each Party shall provide that the owner of a registered trademark has the exclusive right to prevent third parties that do not have the owner's consent from using in the course of trade identical or similar signs, including subsequent geographical indications,11, 12 for goods or services that are related to those goods or services in respect of which the owner's trademark is registered, where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion. In the case of the use of an identical sign for identical goods or services, a likelihood of confusion shall be presumed.

10

Consistent with the definition of a geographical indication in Article 18.1 (Definitions), any sign or combination of signs shall be eligible for protection under one or more of the legal means for protecting geographical indications, or a combination of such means.
11

For greater certainty, the exclusive right in this Article applies to cases of unauthorised use of geographical indications with goods for which the trademark is registered, in cases in which the use of that geographical indication in the course of trade would result in a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the goods.
12

For greater certainty, the Parties understand that this Article should not be interpreted to affect their rights and obligations under Articles 22 and 23 of the TRIPS Agreement.

Article 18.21: Exceptions A Party may provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark, such as fair use of descriptive terms, provided that those exceptions take account of the legitimate interest of the owner of the trademark and of third parties. Article 18.22: Well-Known Trademarks 1. No Party shall require as a condition for determining that a trademark is well-known that the trademark has been registered in the Party or in another jurisdiction, included on a list of well-known trademarks, or given prior recognition as a well-known trademark. 2. Article 6bis of the Paris Convention shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to goods or services that are not identical or similar to those identified by a well known trademark,13 whether registered or not, provided that use of that trademark in relation to those goods or services would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the owner of the trademark, and provided that the interests of the owner of the trademark are likely to be damaged by such use. 3. Each Party recognises the importance of the Joint Recommendation Concerning Provisions on the Protection of Well-Known Marks as adopted by the Assembly of the Paris Union for the Protection of Industrial Property and the General Assembly of WIPO at the Thirty-Fourth Series of Meetings of the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO September 20 to 29, 1999. 4. Each Party shall provide for appropriate measures to refuse the application or cancel the registration and prohibit the use of a trademark that is identical or similar to a well-known trademark14, for identical or similar goods or services, if the use of that trademark is likely to cause confusion with the prior well-known trademark. A Party may also provide such measures including in cases in which the subsequent trademark is likely to deceive. Article 18.23: Procedural Aspects of Examination, Opposition and Cancellation Each Party shall provide a system for the examination and registration of trademarks which includes among other things:

13

In determining whether a trademark is well -known in a Party, that Party need not require that the reputation of the trademark extend beyond the sector of the public that normally deals with the relevant goods or services.
14

The Parties understand that a well-known trademark is one that was already well -known before, as determined by a Party, the application for, registration of or use of the first -mentioned trademark.

Each Party shall provide that: (a) registrations and the publications of applications indicate the goods and services by their names, grouped according to the classes established by the Nice Classification;16 and

15

For greater certainty, cancellation for purposes of this Section may be implemented through nullification or revocation proceedings.
16

A Party that relies on translations of the Nice Classification shall follow updated versions of the Nice Classification to the extent that official translations have been issued and published.

18-12

(b)

goods or services may not be considered as being similar to each other on the ground that, in any registration or publication, they are classified in the same class of the Nice Classification. Conversely, each Party shall provide that goods or services may not be considered as being dissimilar from each other on the ground that, in any registration or publication, they are classified in different classes of the Nice Classification.

Article 18.26: Term of Protection for Trademarks Each Party shall provide that initial registration and each renewal of registration of a trademark is for a term of no less than 10 years. Article 18.27: Non-Recordal of a Licence No Party shall require recordal of trademark licences: (a) (b) to establish the validity of the licence; or as a condition for use of a trademark by a licensee to be deemed to constitute use by the holder in a proceeding that relates to the acquisition, maintenance or enforcement of trademarks.

Article 18.28: Domain Names 1. In connection with each Party's system for the management of its countrycode top-level domain (ccTLD) domain names, the following shall be available: (a) an appropriate procedure for the settlement of disputes, based on, or modelled along the same lines as, the principles established in the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy, as approved by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) or that: (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) is designed to resolve disputes expeditiously and at low cost; is fair and equitable; is not overly burdensome; and does not preclude resort to judicial proceedings; and

(b)

online public access to a reliable and accurate database of contact information concerning domain name registrants,

in accordance with each Party's law and, if applicable, relevant administrator policies regarding protection of privacy and personal data. 2. In connection with each Party's system for the management of ccTLD domain names, appropriate remedies17 shall be available at least in cases in which a person registers or holds, with a bad faith intent to profit, a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark. Section D: Country Names Article 18.29: Country Names Each Party shall provide the legal means for interested persons to prevent commercial use of the country name of a Party in relation to a good in a manner that misleads consumers as to the origin of that good. Section E: Geographical Indications Article 18.30: Recognition of Geographical Indications The Parties recognise that geographical indications may be protected through a trademark or sui generis system or other legal means. Article 18.31: Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications If a Party provides administrative procedures for the protection or recognition of geographical indications, whether through a trademark or a sui generis system, that Party shall with respect to applications for that protection or petitions for that recognition: (a) accept those applications or petitions without requiring intercession by a Party on behalf of its nationals;18

17

The Parties understand that such remedies may, but need not, include, among other things, revocation, cancellation, transfer, damages or injunctive relief.
18

This subparagraph also applies to judicial procedures that protect or recognise a geographical indication.

2. If a Party has protected or recognised a geographical indication through the procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications), that Party shall provide procedures that allow for interested persons to seek the cancellation of a geographical indication, and that allow for the protection or recognition to be cancelled, at least, on the grounds listed in paragraph 1. A Party may provide that the grounds listed in paragraph 1 shall apply as of the time of filing the request for protection or recognition of a geographical indication in the territory of the Party.22 3. No Party shall preclude the possibility that the protection or recognition of a geographical indication may be cancelled, or otherwise cease, on the basis that the protected or recognised term has ceased meeting the conditions upon which the protection or recognition was originally granted in that Party. 4. If a Party has in place a sui generis system for protecting unregistered geographical indications by means of judicial procedures, that Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to deny the protection or recognition of a geographical indication if any of the circumstances identified in paragraph 1 has been established. 23 That Party shall also provide a process that allows interested persons to commence a proceeding on the grounds identified in paragraph 1. 5. If a Party provides protection or recognition of a geographical indication through the procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) to the translation or transliteration of that geographical indication, that Party shall make available procedures that are equivalent to, and grounds that are the same as, those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 with respect to that translation or transliteration.

21

For greater certainty, if a Party provides for the procedures in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) and this Article to be applied to geographical indications for wines and spirits or applications or petitions for those geographical indications, the Parties understand nothing shall require a Party to protect or recognise a geographical indication of any other Party with respect to products of the vine for which the relevant indication is identical with the customary name of a grape variety existing in the territory of that Party.
22

For greater certainty, if the grounds listed in paragraph 1 did not exist in a Party's law as of the time of filing of the request for protection or recognition of a geographical indication under Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications), that Party is not required to apply those grounds for the purposes of paragraph 2 or paragraph 4 of this Article in relation to that geographical indication.
23

As an alternative to this paragraph, if a Party has in place a sui generis system of the type referred to in this paragraph as of the applicable date under Article 18.36.6 (International Agreements), that Party shall at least provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to deny the protection or recognition of a geographical indication if the circumstances identified in paragraph 1(c) have been established.

Article 18.33: Guidelines for Determining Whether a Term is the Term Customary in the Common Language With respect to the procedures in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) and Article 18.32 (Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation), in determining whether a term is the term customary in common language as the common name for the relevant good in the territory of a Party, that Party's authorities shall have the authority to take into account how consumers understand the term in the territory of that Party. Factors relevant to such consumer understanding may include: (a) whether the term is used to refer to the type of good in question, as indicated by competent sources such as dictionaries, newspapers and relevant websites; and how the good referenced by the term is marketed and used in trade in the territory of that Party.24

(b)

Article 18.34: Multi-Component Terms With respect to the procedures in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) and Article 18.32 (Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation), an individual component of a multicomponent term that is protected as a geographical indication in the territory of a Party shall not be protected in that Party if that individual component is a term customary in the common language as the common name for the associated good. Article 18.35: Date of Protection of a Geographical Indication If a Party grants protection or recognition to a geographical indication through the procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications), that protection or recognition shall commence no earlier than the filing date25 in the Party or the registration date in the Party, as applicable.

24

For the purposes of this subparagraph, a Party's authorities may take into account, as appropriate, whether the term is used in relevant international standards recognised by the Parties to refer to a type or class of good in the territory of the Party.
25

For greater certainty, the filing date referred to in this paragraph includes, as applicable, the priority filing date under the Paris Convention.

In respect of an international agreement referred to in paragraph 6 that has geographical indications that have been identified, but have not yet received protection or recognition in the territory of the Party that is a party to that agreement, that Party may fulfil the obligations of paragraph 2 by complying with the obligations of paragraph 1.

18-18

(a) (b)

apply paragraph 1(b); provide an opportunity for interested persons to comment regarding the protection or recognition of the new geographical indication for a reasonable period of time before such a term is protected or recognised; and inform the other Parties of the opportunity to comment, no later than the commencement of the period for comment.

(c)

3. For the purposes of this Article, a Party shall not preclude the possibility that the protection or recognition of a geographical indication could cease. 4. For the purposes of this Article, a Party is not required to apply Article 18.32 (Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation), or obligations equivalent to Article 18.32, to geographical indications for wines and spirits or applications for those geographical indications. 5. Protection or recognition provided pursuant to paragraph 1 shall commence no earlier than the date on which the agreement enters into force or, if that Party grants that protection or recognition on a date after the entry into force of the agreement, on that later date. 6. No Party shall be required to apply this Article to geographical indications that have been specifically identified in, and that are protected or recognised pursuant to, an international agreement involving a Party or a non-Party, provided that the agreement: (a) (b) (c) was concluded, or agreed in principle 29 , prior to the date of conclusion, or agreement in principle, of this Agreement; was ratified by a Party prior to the date of ratification of this Agreement by that Party; or entered into force for a Party prior to the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party.

Section F: Patents and Undisclosed Test or Other Data

Subsection A: General Patents Article 18.37: Patentable Subject Matter 1. Subject to paragraphs 3 and 4, each Party shall make patents available for any invention, whether a product or process, in all fields of technology, provided that the invention is new, involves an inventive step and is capable of industrial application.30 2. Subject to paragraphs 3 and 4 and consistent with paragraph 1, each Party confirms that patents are available for inventions claimed as at least one of the following: new uses of a known product, new methods of using a known product, or new processes of using a known product. A Party may limit those new processes to those that do not claim the use of the product as such. 3. A Party may exclude from patentability inventions, the prevention within their territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect ordre public or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to nature or the environment, provided that such exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by its law. A Party may also exclude from patentability: (a) diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of humans or animals; animals other than microorganisms, and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals, other than nonbiological and microbiological processes.

(b)

4. A Party may also exclude from patentability plants other than microorganisms. However, consistent with paragraph 1 and subject to paragraph 3, each Party confirms that patents are available at least for inventions that are derived from plants.

30

For the purposes of this Section, a Party may deem the terms "inventive step" and "capable of industrial application" to be synonymous with the terms "non-obvious" and "useful", respectively. In determinations regarding inventive step, or non-obviousness, each Party shall consider whether the claimed invention would have been obvious to a person skilled, or having ordinary skill in the art, having regard to the prior art.

18-20

Article 18.38: Grace Period Each Party shall disregard at least information contained in public disclosures used to determine if an invention is novel or has an inventive step, if the public disclosure:31, 32 (a) was made by the patent applicant or by a person that obtained the information directly or indirectly from the patent applicant; and occurred within 12 months prior to the date of the filing of the application in the territory of the Party.

(b)

Article 18.39: Patent Revocation 1. Each Party shall provide that a patent may be cancelled, revoked or nullified only on grounds that would have justified a refusal to grant the patent. A Party may also provide that fraud, misrepresentation or inequitable conduct may be the basis for cancelling, revoking or nullifying a patent or holding a patent unenforceable. 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may provide that a patent may be revoked, provided it is done in a manner consistent with Article 5A of the Paris Convention and the TRIPS Agreement.

Article 18.40: Exceptions A Party may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.

31

No Party shall be required to disregard information contained in applications for, or registrations of, intellectual property rights made available to the public or published by a patent office, unless erroneously published or unless the application was filed without the consent of the inventor or their successor in title, by a third person who obtained the information directly or indirectly from the inventor.
32

For greater certainty, a Party may limit the application of this Article to disclosures made by, or obtained directly or indirectly from, the inventor or joint inventor. For greater certainty, a Party may provide that, for the purposes of this Article, information obtained directly or indirectly from the patent applicant may be information contained in the public disclosure that was authorised by, or derived from, the patent applicant.

18-21

Article 18.41: Other Use Without Authorisation of the Right Holder The Parties understand that nothing in this Chapter limits a Party's rights and obligations under Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement, any waiver or any amendment to that Article that the Parties accept.

Article 18.42: Patent Filing Each Party shall provide that if an invention is made independently by more than one inventor, and separate applications claiming that invention are filed with, or for, the relevant authority of the Party, that Party shall grant the patent on the application that is patentable and that has the earliest filing date or, if applicable, priority date,33 unless that application has, prior to publication,34 been withdrawn, abandoned or refused.

Article 18.43: Amendments, Corrections and Observations Each Party shall provide a patent applicant with at least one opportunity to make amendments, corrections and observations in connection with its application.35

Article 18.44: Publication of Patent Applications 1. Recognising the benefits of transparency in the patent system, each Party shall endeavour to publish unpublished pending patent applications promptly after the expiration of 18 months from the filing date or, if priority is claimed, from the earliest priority date. 2. If a pending application is not published promptly in accordance with paragraph 1, a Party shall publish that application or the corresponding patent, as soon as practicable.

33

A Party shall not be required to apply this Article in cases involving derivation or in situations involving any application that has or had, at any time, at least one claim having an effective filing date before the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party or any application that has or had, at any time, a priority claim to an application that contains or contained such a claim.
34

For greater certainty, a Party may grant the patent to the subsequent application that is patentable, if an earlier application has been withdrawn, abandoned, or refused, or is not prior art against the subsequent application.
35

A Party may provide that such amendments do not go beyond the scope of the disclosure of the invention, as of the filing date.

18-22

3. Each Party shall provide that an applicant may request the early publication of an application prior to the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph 1.

Article 18.45: Information Relating to Published Patent Applications and Granted Patents For published patent applications and granted patents, and in accordance with the Party's requirements for prosecution of such applications and patents, each Party shall make available to the public at least the following information, to the extent that such information is in the possession of the competent authorities and is generated on, or after, the date of the entry into force of this Agreement for that Party: (a) search and examination results, including details of, or information related to, relevant prior art searches; as appropriate, non-confidential communications from applicants; and patent and non-patent related literature citations submitted by applicants and relevant third parties.

Article 18.46: Patent Term Adjustment for Unreasonable Granting Authority Delays 1. Each Party shall make best efforts to process patent applications in an efficient and timely manner, with a view to avoiding unreasonable or unnecessary delays. 2. A Party may provide procedures for a patent applicant to request to expedite the examination of its patent application. 3. If there are unreasonable delays in a Party's issuance of patents, that Party shall provide the means to, and at the request of the patent owner shall, adjust the term of the patent to compensate for such delays.36 4. For the purposes of this Article, an unreasonable delay at least shall include a delay in the issuance of a patent of more than five years from the date of filing of the application in the territory of the Party, or three years after a request for examination of the application has been made, whichever is later. A Party may exclude, from the determination of such delays, periods of time that do not

Annex 18-D applies to this paragraph.

18-23

occur during the processing37 of, or the examination of, the patent application by the granting authority; periods of time that are not directly attributable 38 to the granting authority; as well as periods of time that are attributable to the patent applicant.39

Subsection B: Measures Relating to Agricultural Chemical Products

Article 18.47: Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data for Agricultural Chemical Products 1. If a Party requires, as a condition for granting marketing approval 40 for a new agricultural chemical product, the submission of undisclosed test or other data concerning the safety and efficacy of the product,41 that Party shall not permit third persons, without the consent of the person that previously submitted such information, to market the same or a similar 42 product on the basis of that information or the marketing approval granted to the person that submitted such test or other data for at least 10 years43 from the date of marketing approval of the new agricultural chemical product in the territory of the Party. 2. If a Party permits, as a condition of granting marketing approval for a new agricultural chemical product, the submission of evidence of a prior marketing approval of the product in another territory, that Party shall not permit third persons, without the consent of the person that previously submitted undisclosed
37

For the purposes of this paragraph, a Party may interpret processing to mean initial administrative processing and administrative processing at the time of grant.
38

A Party may treat delays "that are not directly attributable to the granting authority" as delays that are outside the direction or control of the granting authority.
39

Notwithstanding Article 18.10 (Application of Chapter to Existing Subject Matter and Prior Acts), this Article shall apply to all patent applications filed after the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party, or the date two years after the signing of this Agreement, whichever is later for that Party.
40

For the purposes of this Chapter, the term "marketing approval" is synonymous with "sanitary approval" under a Party's law. . 41 Each Party confirms that the obligations of this Article apply to cases in which the Party requires the submission of undisclosed test or other data concerning: (a) only the safety of the product, (b) only the efficacy of the product or (c) both.
42

For greater certainty, for the purposes of this Section, an agricultural chemical product is "similar" to a previously approved agricultural chemical product if the marketing approval, or, in the alternative, the applicant's request for such approval, of that similar agricultural chemical product is based upon the undisclosed test or other data concerning the safety and efficacy of the previously approved agricultural chemical product, or the prior approval of that previously approved product.
43

For greater certainty, a Party may limit the period of protection under this Article to 10 years.

18-24

test or other data concerning the safety and efficacy of the product in support of that prior marketing approval, to market the same or a similar product based on that undisclosed test or other data, or other evidence of the prior marketing approval in the other territory, for at least 10 years from the date of marketing approval of the new agricultural chemical product in the territory of the Party. 3. For the purposes of this Article, a new agricultural chemical product is one that contains 44 a chemical entity that has not been previously approved in the territory of the Party for use in an agricultural chemical product.

Subsection C: Measures Relating to Pharmaceutical Products

Article 18.48: Patent Term Adjustment for Unreasonable Curtailment 1. Each Party shall make best efforts to process applications for marketing approval of pharmaceutical products in an efficient and timely manner, with a view to avoiding unreasonable or unnecessary delays. 2. With respect to a pharmaceutical product45 that is subject to a patent, each Party shall make available an adjustment46 of the patent term to compensate the patent owner for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term as a result of the marketing approval process.47, 48 3. For greater certainty, in implementing the obligations of this Article, each Party may provide for conditions and limitations, provided that the Party continues to give effect to this Article. 4. With the objective of avoiding unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term, a Party may adopt or maintain procedures that expedite the processing of marketing approval applications.
44

For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat "contain" as meaning utilise. For greater certainty, for the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat "utilise" as requiring the new chemical entity to be primarily responsible for the product's intended effect.
45

A Party may comply with the obligations of this paragraph with respect to a pharmaceutical product or, alternatively, with respect to a pharmaceutical substance.
46

For greater certainty, a Party may alternatively make available a period of additional sui generis protection to compensate for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term as a result of the marketing approval process. The sui generis protection shall confer the rights conferred by the patent, subject to any conditions and limitations pursuant to paragraph 3.
47

Notwithstanding Article 18.10 (Application of Chapter to Existing Subject Matter and Prior Acts), this Article shall apply to all applications for marketing approval filed after the date of entry into force of this Article for that Party.
48

Annex 18-D applies to this paragraph.

18-25

Article 18.49: Regulatory Review Exception Without prejudice to the scope of, and consistent with, Article 18.40 (Exceptions), each Party shall adopt or maintain a regulatory review exception49 for pharmaceutical products. Article 18.50: Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data50 1. (a) If a Party requires, as a condition for granting marketing approval for a new pharmaceutical product, the submission of undisclosed test or other data concerning the safety and efficacy of the product, 51 that Party shall not permit third persons, without the consent of the person that previously submitted such information, to market the same or a similar52 product on the basis of: (i) (ii) that information; or the marketing approval granted to the person that submitted such information,

for at least five years53 from the date of marketing approval of the new pharmaceutical product in the territory of the Party. (b) If a Party permits, as a condition of granting marketing approval for a new pharmaceutical product, the submission of evidence of prior marketing approval of the product in another territory, that Party shall not permit third persons, without the consent of a person that previously submitted such information concerning the safety

49

For greater certainty, consistent with Article 18.40 (Exceptions), nothing prevents a Party from providing that regulatory review exceptions apply for purposes of regulatory reviews in that Party, in another country or both.
50

Annex 18-B and Annex 18-C apply to paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.

51

Each Party confirms that the obligations of this Article, and Article 18.51 (Biologics) apply to cases in which the Party requires the submission of undisclosed test or other data concerning: (a) only the safety of the product, (b) only the efficacy of the product or (c) both.
52

For greater certainty, for the purposes of this Section, a pharmaceutical product is "similar" to a previously approved pharmaceutical product if the marketing approval, or, in the alternative, the applicant's request for such approval, of that similar pharmaceutical product is based upon the undisclosed test or other data concerning the safety and efficacy of the previously approved pharmaceutical product, or the prior approval of that previously approved product.

Each Party shall:55 (a) apply paragraph 1, mutatis mutandis, for a period of at least three years with respect to new clinical information submitted as required in support of a marketing approval of a previously approved pharmaceutical product covering a new indication, new formulation or new method of administration; or, alternatively, apply paragraph 1, mutatis mutandis, for a period of at least five years to new pharmaceutical products that contain 56 a chemical entity that has not been previously approved in that Party.57

(b)

3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2 and Article 18.51 (Biologics), a Party may take measures to protect public health in accordance with: (a) (b) the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health; any waiver of any provision of the TRIPS Agreement granted by WTO Members in accordance with the WTO Agreement to implement the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health and that is in force between the Parties; or any amendment of the TRIPS Agreement to implement the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health that enters into force with respect to the Parties.

(c)

Annex 18-D applies to this subparagraph.

55

A Party that provides a period of at least eight years of protection pursuant to paragraph 1 is not required to apply paragraph 2.
56

For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat "contain" as meaning utilise.

57

For the purposes of Article 18.50.2(b) (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data), a Party may choose to protect only the undisclosed test or other data concerning the safety and efficacy relating to the chemical entity that has not been previously approved.

18-27

Article 18.51: Biologics58 1. With regard to protecting new biologics, a Party shall either: (a) with respect to the first marketing approval in a Party of a new pharmaceutical product that is or contains a biologic,59,60 provide effective market protection through the implementation of Article 18.50.1 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.50.3, mutatis mutandis, for a period of at least eight years from the date of first marketing approval of that product in that Party; or, alternatively, with respect to the first marketing approval in a Party of a new pharmaceutical product that is or contains a biologic, provide effective market protection: (i) through the implementation of Article 18.50.1 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.50.3, mutatis mutandis, for a period of at least five years from the date of first marketing approval of that product in that Party, through other measures, and recognising that market circumstances also contribute to effective market protection

(ii) (iii)

to deliver a comparable outcome in the market. 2. For the purposes of this Section, each Party shall apply this Article to, at a minimum, a product that is, or, alternatively, contains, a protein produced using biotechnology processes, for use in human beings for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition.

58

Annex 18-B, Annex 18-C and Annex 18-D apply to this Article. Nothing requires a Party to extend the protection of this paragraph to: (a) (b) any second or subsequent marketing approval of such a pharmaceutical product; or a pharmaceutical product that is or contains a previously approved biologic.

59

60

Each Party may provide that an applicant may request approval of a pharmaceutical product that is or contains a biologic under the procedures set forth in Article 18.50.1(a) (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.50.1(b) within five years of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party, provided that other pharmaceutical products in the same class of products have been approved by that Party under the procedures set forth in Article 18.50.1(a) and Article 18.50.1(b) before the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party.

18-28

3. Recognising that international and domestic regulation of new pharmaceutical products that are or contain a biologic is in a formative stage and that market circumstances may evolve over time, the Parties shall consult after 10 years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, or as otherwise decided by the Commission, to review the period of exclusivity provided in paragraph 1 and the scope of application provided in paragraph 2, with a view to providing effective incentives for the development of new pharmaceutical products that are or contain a biologic, as well as with a view to facilitating the timely availability of follow-on biosimilars, and to ensuring that the scope of application remains consistent with international developments regarding approval of additional categories of new pharmaceutical products that are or contain a biologic.

Article 18.52: Definition of New Pharmaceutical Product For the purposes of Article 18.50.1 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data), a new pharmaceutical product means a pharmaceutical product that does not contain61 a chemical entity that has been previously approved in that Party.

Article 18.53: Measures Relating to the Marketing of Certain Pharmaceutical Products 1. If a Party permits, as a condition of approving the marketing of a pharmaceutical product, persons, other than the person originally submitting the safety and efficacy information, to rely on evidence or information concerning the safety and efficacy of a product that was previously approved, such as evidence of prior marketing approval by the Party or in another territory, that Party shall provide: (a) a system to provide notice to a patent holder 62 or to allow for a patent holder to be notified prior to the marketing of such a pharmaceutical product, that such other person is seeking to market that product during the term of an applicable patent claiming the approved product or its approved method of use; adequate time and opportunity for such a patent holder to seek, prior to the marketing 63 of an allegedly infringing product, available remedies in subparagraph (c); and

(b)

61

For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat "contain" as meaning utilise.

62

For greater certainty, for the purposes of this Article, a Party may provide that a "patent holder" includes a patent licensee or the authorised holder of marketing approval.
63

For the purposes of paragraph 1(b), a Party may treat "marketing" as commencing at the time of listing for purposes of the reimbursement of pharmaceutical products pursuant to a national

18-29

(c)

procedures, such as judicial or administrative proceedings, and expeditious remedies, such as preliminary injunctions or equivalent effective provisional measures, for the timely resolution of disputes concerning the validity or infringement of an applicable patent claiming an approved pharmaceutical product or its approved method of use.

2. As an alternative to paragraph 1, a Party shall instead adopt or maintain a system other than judicial proceedings that precludes, based upon patent-related information submitted to the marketing approval authority by a patent holder or the applicant for marketing approval, or based on direct coordination between the marketing approval authority and the patent office, the issuance of marketing approval to any third person seeking to market a pharmaceutical product subject to a patent claiming that product, unless by consent or acquiescence of the patent holder.

Article 18.54: Alteration of Period of Protection Subject to Article 18.50.3 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data), if a product is subject to a system of marketing approval in the territory of a Party pursuant to Article 18.47 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data for Agricultural Chemical Products), Article 18.50 or Article 18.51 (Biologics) and is also covered by a patent in the territory of that Party, the Party shall not alter the period of protection that it provides pursuant to Article 18.47, Article 18.50 or Article 18.51 in the event that the patent protection terminates on a date earlier than the end of the period of protection specified in Article 18.47, Article 18.50 or Article 18.51. Section G: Industrial Designs

Article 18.55: Protection 1. Each Party shall ensure adequate and effective protection of industrial designs and also confirms that protection for industrial designs is available for designs: (a) (b) embodied in a part of an article; or, alternatively, having a particular regard, where appropriate, to a part of an article in the context of the article as a whole.

This Article is subject to Articles 25 and 26 of the TRIPS Agreement.

Article 18.56: Improving Industrial Design Systems The Parties recognise the importance of improving the quality and efficiency of their respective industrial design registration systems, as well as facilitating the process of cross-border acquisition of rights in their respective industrial design systems, including giving due consideration to ratifying or acceding to the Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Industrial Designs, done at Geneva, July 2, 1999. Section H: Copyright and Related Rights Article 18.57: Definitions For the purposes of Article 18.58 (Right of Reproduction) and Article 18.60 (Right of Distribution) through Article 18.70 (Collective Management), the following definitions apply with respect to performers and producers of phonograms: broadcasting means the transmission by wireless means for public reception of sounds or of images and sounds or of the representations thereof; such transmission by satellite is also "broadcasting"; transmission of encrypted signals is "broadcasting" if the means for decrypting are provided to the public by the broadcasting organisation or with its consent; communication to the public of a performance or a phonogram means the transmission to the public by any medium, other than by broadcasting, of sounds of a performance or the sounds or the representations of sounds fixed in a phonogram; fixation means the embodiment of sounds, or of the representations thereof, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or communicated through a device; performers means actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret, or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; phonogram means the fixation of the sounds of a performance or of other sounds, or of a representation of sounds, other than in the form of a fixation incorporated in a cinematographic or other audio-visual work;

18-31

producer of a phonogram means a person that takes the initiative and has the responsibility for the first fixation of the sounds of a performance or other sounds, or the representations of sounds; and publication of a performance or phonogram means the offering of copies of the performance or the phonogram to the public, with the consent of the right holder, and provided that copies are offered to the public in reasonable quantity. Article 18.58: Right of Reproduction Each Party shall provide 64 to authors, performers and producers of phonograms65 the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit all reproduction of their works, performances or phonograms in any manner or form, including in electronic form. Article 18.59: Right of Communication to the Public Without prejudice to Article 11(1)(ii), Article 11bis(1)(i) and (ii), Article 11ter(1)(ii), Article 14(1)(ii), and Article 14bis(1) of the Berne Convention, each Party shall provide to authors the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the communication to the public of their works, by wire or wireless means, including the making available to the public of their works in such a way that members of the public may access these works from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.66 Article 18.60: Right of Distribution Each Party shall provide to authors, performers and producers of phonograms the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the making available to the public of the original and copies 67 of their works, performances and phonograms through sale or other transfer of ownership.
64

For greater certainty, the Parties understand that it is a matter for each Party's law to prescribe that works, performances or phonograms in general or any specified categories of works, performances and phonograms are not protected by copyright or related rights unless the work, performance or phonogram has been fixed in some material form.
65

References to "authors, performers, and producers of phonograms" refer also to any of their successors in interest.
66

The Parties understand that the mere provision of physical facilities for enabling or making a communication does not in itself amount to communication within the meaning of this Chapter or the Berne Convention. The Parties further understand that nothing in this Article precludes a Party from applying Article 11bis(2) of the Berne Convention.
67

The expressions "copies" and "original and copies", that are subject to the right of distribution in this Article, refer exclusively to fixed copies that can be put into circulation as tangible objects.

18-32

Article 18.61: No Hierarchy Each Party shall provide that in cases in which authorisation is needed from both the author of a work embodied in a phonogram and a performer or producer that owns rights in the phonogram: (a) the need for the authorisation of the author does not cease to exist because the authorisation of the performer or producer is also required; and the need for the authorisation of the performer or producer does not cease to exist because the authorisation of the author is also required.

(b)

Article 18.62: Related Rights 1. Each Party shall accord the rights provided for in this Chapter with respect to performers and producers of phonograms: to the performers and producers of phonograms that are nationals 68 of another Party; and to performances or phonograms first published or first fixed69 in the territory of another Party. 70 A performance or phonogram shall be considered first published in the territory of a Party if it is published in the territory of that Party within 30 days of its original publication. 2. Each Party shall provide to performers the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit: (a) the broadcasting and communication to the public of their unfixed performances, unless the performance is already a broadcast performance; and the fixation of their unfixed performances.

(b)

68

For the purposes of determining criteria for eligibility under this Article, with respect to performers, a Party may treat "nationals" as those who would meet the criteria for eligibility under Article 3 of the WPPT.
69

For the purposes of this Article, fixation means the finalisation of the master tape or its equivalent.
70

For greater certainty, in this paragraph with respect to performances or phonograms first published or first fixed in the territory of a Party, a Party may apply the criterion of publication, or alternatively, the criterion of fixation, or both. For greater certainty, consistent with Article 18.8 (National Treatment), each Party shall accord to performances and phonograms first published or first fixed in the territory of another Party treatment no less favourable than it accords to performances or phonograms first published or first fixed in its own territory.

18-33

3.

(a)

Each Party shall provide to performers and producers of phonograms the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the broadcasting or any communication to the public of their performances or phonograms, by wire or wireless means,71, 72 and the making available to the public of those performances or phonograms in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) and Article 18.65 (Limitations and Exceptions), the application of the right referred to in subparagraph (a) to analog transmissions and non-interactive free over-the-air broadcasts, and exceptions or limitations to this right for those activities, is a matter of each Party's law.73

(b)

Article 18.63: Term of Protection for Copyright and Related Rights Each Party shall provide that in cases in which the term of protection of a work, performance or phonogram is to be calculated:74 (a) on the basis of the life of a natural person, the term shall be not less than the life of the author and 70 years after the author's death;75 and on a basis other than the life of a natural person, the term shall be:

(b)
71

With respect to broadcasting and communication to the public, a Party may satisfy the obligation by applying Article 15(1) and Article 15(4) of the WPPT and may also apply Article 15(2) of the WPPT, provided that it is done in a manner consistent with that Party's obligations under Article 18.8 (National Treatment).
72

For greater certainty, the obligation under this paragraph does not include broadcasting or communication to the public, by wire or wireless means, of the sounds or representations of sounds fixed in a phonogram that are incorporated in a cinematographic or other audio-visual work.
73

For the purposes of this subparagraph the Parties understand that a Party may provide for the retransmission of non-interactive, free over-the-air broadcasts, provided that these retransmissions are lawfully permitted by that Party's government communications authority; any entity engaging in these retransmissions complies with the relevant rules, orders or regulations of that authority; and these retransmissions do not include those delivered and accessed over the Internet. For greater certainty this footnote does not limit a Party's ability to avail itself of this subparagraph.
74

For greater certainty, in implementing this Article, nothing prevents a Party from promoting certainty for the legitimate use and exploitation of a work, performance or phonogram during its term of protection, consistent with Article 18.65 (Limitations and Exceptions) and that Party's international obligations.
75

The Parties understand that if a Party provides its nationals a term of copyright protection that exceeds life of the author plus 70 years, nothing in this Article or Article 18.8 (National Treatment) shall preclude that Party from applying Article 7(8) of the Berne Convention with respect to the term in excess of the term provided in this subparagraph of protection for works of another Party.

18-34

(i)

not less than 70 years from the end of the calendar year of the first authorised publication76 of the work, performance or phonogram; or failing such authorised publication within 25 years from the creation of the work, performance or phonogram, not less than 70 years from the end of the calendar year of the creation of the work, performance or phonogram.77

(ii)

Article 18.64: Application of Article 18 of the Berne Convention and Article 14.6 of the TRIPS Agreement Each Party shall apply Article 18 of the Berne Convention and Article 14.6 of the TRIPS Agreement, mutatis mutandis, to works, performances and phonograms, and the rights in and protections afforded to that subject matter as required by this Section. Article 18.65: Limitations and Exceptions 1. With respect to this Section, each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights to certain special cases that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work, performance or phonogram, and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder. 2. This Article does not reduce or extend the scope of applicability of the limitations and exceptions permitted by the TRIPS Agreement, the Berne Convention, the WCT or the WPPT. Article 18.66: Balance in Copyright and Related Rights Systems Each Party shall endeavour to achieve an appropriate balance in its copyright and related rights system, among other things by means of limitations or exceptions that are consistent with Article 18.65 (Limitations and Exceptions), including those for the digital environment, giving due consideration to legitimate purposes such as, but not limited to: criticism; comment; news reporting; teaching, scholarship, research, and other similar purposes; and facilitating access
76

For greater certainty, for the purposes of subparagraph (b), if a Party's law provides for the calculation of term from fixation rather than from the first authorised publication, that Party may continue to calculate the term from fixation.
77

For greater certainty, a Party may calculate a term of protection for an anonymous or pseudonymous work or a work of joint authorship in accordance with Article 7(3) or Article 7 bis of the Berne Convention, provided that the Party implements the corresponding numerical term of protection required under this Article.

to published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled.78, 79 Article 18.67: Contractual Transfers Each Party shall provide that for copyright and related rights, any person acquiring or holding any economic right80 in a work, performance or phonogram: (a) (b) may freely and separately transfer that right by contract; and by virtue of contract, including contracts of employment underlying the creation of works, performances or phonograms, shall be able to exercise that right in that person's own name and enjoy fully the benefits derived from that right.81

Article 18.68: Technological Protection Measures (TPMs)82 1. In order to provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures that authors, performers, and producers of phonograms use in connection with the exercise of their rights and that restrict unauthorised acts in respect of their works, performances, and phonograms, each Party shall provide that any person that: (a) knowingly, or having reasonable grounds to know, 83 circumvents without authority any effective technological measure that controls access to a protected work, performance, or phonogram;84 or

As recognised by the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled, done at Marrakesh, June 27, 2013 (Marrakesh Treaty). The Parties recognise that some Parties facilitate the availability of works in accessible formats for beneficiaries beyond the requirements of the Marrakesh Treaty.
79

For greater certainty, a use that has commercial aspects may in appropriate circumstances be considered to have a legitimate purpose under Article 18.65 (Limitations and Exceptions).
80

For greater certainty, this provision does not affect the exercise of moral rights.

81

Nothing in this Article affects a Party's ability to establish: (i) which specific contracts underlying the creation of works, performances or phonograms shall, in the absence of a written agreement, result in a transfer of economic rights by operation of law; and (ii) reasonable limits to protect the interests of the original right holders, taking into account the legitimate interests of the transferees.
82

Nothing in this Agreement requires a Party to restrict the importation or domestic sale of a device that does not render effective a technological measure the only purpose of which is to control market segmentation for legitimate physical copies of a cinematographic film, and is not otherwise a violation of its law.

18-36

(b)

manufactures, imports, distributes,85 offers for sale or rental to the public, or otherwise provides devices, products, or components, or offers to the public or provides services, that: (i) are promoted, advertised, or otherwise marketed by that person 86 for the purpose of circumventing any effective technological measure; have only a limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent any effective technological measure;87 or are primarily designed, produced, or performed for the purpose of circumventing any effective technological measure,

(ii)

(iii)

is liable and subject to the remedies provided for in Article 18.74 (Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies). Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied if any person is found to have engaged wilfully88 and for the purposes of commercial advantage or financial gain89 in any of the above activities.90

83

For the purposes of this subparagraph, a Party may provide that reasonable grounds to know may be demonstrated through reasonable evidence, taking into account the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged illegal act.
84

For greater certainty, no Party is required to impose civil or criminal liability under this subparagraph for a person that circumvents any effective technological measure that protects any of the exclusive rights of copyright or related rights in a protected work, performance or phonogram, but does not control access to such that work, performance or phonogram.
85

A Party may provide that the obligations described in this subparagraph with respect to manufacturing, importation, and distribution apply only in cases in which those activities are undertaken for sale or rental, or if those activities prejudice the interests of the right holder of the copyright or related right.
86

The Parties understand that this provision still applies in cases in which the person promotes, advertises, or markets through the services of a third person.
87

A Party may comply with this paragraph if the conduct referred to in this subparagraph does not have a commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent an effective technological measure.
88

For greater certainty, for purposes of this Article and Article 18.69 (RMI), wilfulness contains a knowledge element.
89

For greater certainty, for purposes of this Article, Article 18.69 (RMI) and Article 18.77 (Criminal Procedures and Penalties), the Parties understand that a Party may treat "financial gain" as "commercial purposes".

18-37

A Party may provide that the criminal procedures and penalties do not apply to a non-profit library, museum, archive, educational institution, or public noncommercial broadcasting entity. A Party may also provide that the remedies provided for in Article 18.74 (Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies) do not apply to any of the same entities provided that the above activities are carried out in good faith without knowledge that the conduct is prohibited. 2. In implementing paragraph 1, no Party shall be obligated to require that the design of, or the design and selection of parts and components for, a consumer electronics, telecommunications, or computing product provide for a response to any particular technological measure, provided that the product does not otherwise violate a measure implementing paragraph 1. 3. Each Party shall provide that a violation of a measure implementing this Article is independent of any infringement that might occur under the Party's law on copyright and related rights.91 4. With regard to measures implementing paragraph 1: (a) a Party may provide certain limitations and exceptions to the measures implementing paragraph 1(a) or paragraph 1(b) in order to enable non-infringing uses if there is an actual or likely adverse impact of those measures on those non-infringing uses, as determined through a legislative, regulatory, or administrative process in accordance with the Party's law, giving due consideration to evidence when presented in that process, including with respect to whether appropriate and effective measures have been taken by rights holders to enable the beneficiaries to enjoy the limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights under that Party's law;92 any limitations or exceptions to a measure that implements paragraph 1(b) shall be permitted only to enable the legitimate use of a limitation or exception permissible under this Article by its

(b)

90

For greater certainty, no Party is required to impose liability under this Article and Article 18.69 (RMI) for actions taken by that Party or a third person acting with the authorisation or consent of that Party.
91

For greater certainty, a Party is not required to treat the criminal act of circumvention set forth in paragraph 1(a) as an independent violation, where the Party criminally penalises such acts through other means.
92

For greater certainty, nothing in this provision requires a Party to make a new determination via the legislative, regulatory, or administrative process with respect to limitations and exceptions to the legal protection of effective technological measures: (i) previously established pursuant to trade agreements in force between two or more Parties; or (ii) previously implemented by the Parties, provided that such limitations and exceptions are otherwise consistent with this paragraph.

intended beneficiaries 93 and does not authorise the making available of devices, products, components, or services beyond those intended beneficiaries;94 and (c) a Party shall not, by providing limitations and exceptions under paragraph 4(a) and paragraph 4(b), undermine the adequacy of that Party's legal system for the protection of effective technological measures, or the effectiveness of legal remedies against the circumvention of such measures, that authors, performers, or producers of phonograms use in connection with the exercise of their rights, or that restrict unauthorised acts in respect of their works, performances or phonograms, as provided for in this Chapter.

5. Effective technological measure means any effective 95 technology, device, or component that, in the normal course of its operation, controls access to a protected work, performance, or phonogram, or protects copyright or related rights related to a work, performance or phonogram. Article 18.69: Rights Management Information (RMI)96 1. In order to provide adequate and effective legal remedies to protect RMI: (a) each Party shall provide that any person that, without authority, and knowing, or having reasonable grounds to know, that it would induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement of the copyright or related right of authors, performers or producers of phonograms: (i) knowingly97 removes or alters any RMI;

93

For greater certainty, a Party may provide an exception to paragraph 1(b) without providing a corresponding exception to paragraph 1(a), provided that the exception to paragraph 1(b) is limited to enabling a legitimate use that is within the scope of limitations or exceptions to paragraph 1(a) as provided under this subparagraph.
94

For the purposes of interpreting paragraph 4(b) only, paragraph 1(a) should be read to apply to all effective technological measures as defined in paragraph 5, mutatis mutandis.
95

For greater certainty, a technological measure that can, in a usual case, be circumvented accidentally is not an "effective" technological measure.
96

A Party may comply with the obligations in this Article by providing legal protection only to electronic RMI.
97

For greater certainty, a Party may extend the protection afforded by this paragraph to circumstances in which a person engages without knowledge in the acts in sub-subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii), and to other related right holders.

18-39

(ii)

knowingly distributes or imports for distribution RMI knowing that the RMI has been altered without authority; 98 or knowingly distributes, imports for distribution, broadcasts, communicates or makes available to the public copies of works, performances or phonograms, knowing that RMI has been removed or altered without authority,

is liable and subject to the remedies set out in Article 18.74 (Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies). Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied if any person is found to have engaged wilfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or financial gain in any of the above activities. A Party may provide that the criminal procedures and penalties do not apply to a non-profit library, museum, archive, educational institution or public noncommercial broadcasting entity.99 2. For greater certainty, nothing prevents a Party from excluding from a measure that implements paragraph 1 a lawfully authorised activity that is carried out for the purpose of law enforcement, essential security interests or other related governmental purposes, such as the performance of a statutory function. 3. For greater certainty, nothing in this Article shall obligate a Party to require a right holder in a work, performance or phonogram to attach RMI to copies of the work, performance or phonogram, or to cause RMI to appear in connection with a communication of the work, performance or phonogram to the public. 4. RMI means: (a) information that identifies a work, performance or phonogram, the author of the work, the performer of the performance or the producer of the phonogram; or the owner of any right in the work, performance or phonogram; information about the terms and conditions of the use of the work, performance or phonogram; or

(b)

98

A Party may comply with its obligations under this sub -subparagraph by providing for civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of moral rights under its copyright law. A Party may also meet its obligation under this sub -subparagraph, if it provides effective protection for original compilations, provided that the acts described in this sub -subparagraph are treated as infringements of copyright in those original compilations.
99

For greater certainty, a Party may treat a broadcasting entity established without a profit-making purpose under its law as a public non-commercial broadcasting entity.

(c)

any numbers or codes that represent the information referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b),

if any of these items is attached to a copy of the work, performance or phonogram or appears in connection with the communication or making available of a work, performance or phonogram to the public. Article 18.70: Collective Management The Parties recognise the important role of collective management societies for copyright and related rights in collecting and distributing royalties100 based on practices that are fair, efficient, transparent and accountable, which may include appropriate record keeping and reporting mechanisms. Section I: Enforcement Article 18.71: General Obligations 1. Each Party shall ensure that enforcement procedures as specified in this Section are available under its law101 so as to permit effective action against any act of infringement of intellectual property rights covered by this Chapter, including expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and remedies that constitute a deterrent to future infringements. 102 These procedures shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against their abuse. 2. Each Party confirms that the enforcement procedures set forth in Article 18.74 (Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies), Article 18.75 (Provisional Measures) and Article 18.77 (Criminal Procedures and Penalties) shall be available to the same extent with respect to acts of trademark infringement, as well as copyright or related rights infringement, in the digital environment. 3. Each Party shall ensure that its procedures concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights are fair and equitable. These procedures shall not be unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays.
100

For greater certainty, royalties may include equitable remuneration. For greater certainty, "law" is not limited to legislation.

This Section does not create any obligation: (a) to put in place a judicial system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights distinct from that for the enforcement of law in general, nor does it affect the capacity of each Party to enforce its law in general; or with respect to the distribution of resources as between the enforcement of intellectual property rights and the enforcement of law in general.

(b)

5. In implementing the provisions of this Section in its intellectual property system, each Party shall take into account the need for proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement of the intellectual property right and the applicable remedies and penalties, as well as the interests of third parties. Article 18.72: Presumptions 1. In civil, criminal and, if applicable, administrative proceedings involving copyright or related rights, each Party shall provide for a presumption103 that, in the absence of proof to the contrary: (a) the person whose name is indicated in the usual manner104 as the author, performer or producer of the work, performance or phonogram, or if applicable the publisher, is the designated right holder in that work, performance or phonogram; and the copyright or related right subsists in such subject matter.

(b)

2. In connection with the commencement of a civil, administrative or criminal enforcement proceeding involving a registered trademark that has been substantively examined by its competent authority, each Party shall provide that the trademark be considered prima facie valid. 3. In connection with the commencement of a civil or administrative enforcement proceeding involving a patent that has been substantively examined and granted105 by the competent authority of a Party, that Party shall provide that
103

For greater certainty, a Party may implement this Article on the basis of sworn statements or documents having evidentiary value, such as statutory declarations. A Party may also provide that these presumptions are rebuttable presumptions that may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary.
104

For greater certainty, a Party may establish the means by which it shall determine what constitutes the "usual manner" for a particular physical support.
105

For greater certainty, nothing in this Chapter prevents a Party from making available third party procedures in connection with its fulfilment of the obligations under paragraphs 2 and 3.

18-42

each claim in the patent be considered prima facie to satisfy the applicable criteria of patentability in the territory of the Party.106, 107 Article 18.73: Enforcement Practices with Respect to Intellectual Property Rights 1. Each Party shall provide that final judicial decisions and administrative rulings of general application pertaining to the enforcement of intellectual property rights: (a) preferably are in writing and state any relevant findings of fact and the reasoning or the legal basis on which the decisions and rulings are based; and are published108 or, if publication is not practicable, otherwise made available to the public in a national language in such a manner as to enable interested persons and Parties to become acquainted with them.

(b)

2. Each Party recognises the importance of collecting and analysing statistical data and other relevant information concerning infringements of intellectual property rights as well as collecting information on best practices to prevent and combat infringements. 3. Each Party shall publish or otherwise make available to the public information on its efforts to provide effective enforcement of intellectual property rights in its civil, administrative and criminal systems, such as statistical information that the Party may collect for such purposes.

106

For greater certainty, if a Party provides its administrative authorities with the exclusive authority to determine the validity of a registered trademark or patent, nothing in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall prevent that Party's competent authority from suspending enforcement procedures until the validity of the registered trademark or patent is determined by the administrative authority. In those validity procedures, the party challenging the validity of the registered trademark or patent shall be required to prove that the registered trademark or patent is not valid. Notwithstanding this requirement, a Party may require the trademark holder to provide evidence of first use.
107

A Party may provide that this paragraph applies only to those patents that have been applied for, examined and granted after the entry into force of this Agreement for that Party.
108

For greater certainty, a Party may satisfy the requirement for publication by making the decision or ruling available to the public on the Internet.

Article 18.74: Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies 1. Each Party shall make available to right holders civil judicial procedures concerning the enforcement of any intellectual property right covered in this Chapter.109 2. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order injunctive relief that conforms to Article 44 of the TRIPS Agreement, including to prevent goods that involve the infringement of an intellectual property right under the law of the Party providing that relief from entering into the channels of commerce. 3. Each Party shall provide110 that, in civil judicial proceedings, its judicial authorities have the authority at least to order the infringer to pay the right holder damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered because of an infringement of that person's intellectual property right by an infringer who knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in infringing activity. 4. In determining the amount of damages under paragraph 3, each Party's judicial authorities shall have the authority to consider, among other things, any legitimate measure of value the right holder submits, which may include lost profits, the value of the infringed goods or services measured by the market price, or the suggested retail price. 5. At least in cases of copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings, its judicial authorities have the authority to order the infringer, at least in cases described in paragraph 3, to pay the right holder the infringer's profits that are attributable to the infringement.111 6. In civil judicial proceedings with respect to the infringement of copyright or related rights protecting works, phonograms or performances, each Party shall establish or maintain a system that provides for one or more of the following:

109

For the purposes of this Article, the term "right holders" shall include those authorised licensees, federations and associations that have the legal standing and authority to assert such rights. The term "authorised licensee" shall include the exclusive licensee of any one or more of the exclusive intellectual property rights encompassed in a given intellectual property.
110

A Party may also provide that the right holder may not be entitled to any of the remedies set out in paragraphs 3, 5 and 7 if there is a finding of non-use of a trademark. For greater certainty, there is no obligation for a Party to provide for the possibility of any of the remedies in paragraphs 3, 5, 6 and 7 to be ordered in parallel.
111

A Party may comply with this paragraph through presuming those profits to be the damages referred to in paragraph 3.

18-44

(a) (b)

pre-established damages, which shall be available on the election of the right holder; or additional damages.112

7. In civil judicial proceedings with respect to trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall also establish or maintain a system that provides for one or more of the following: (a) (b) pre-established damages, which shall be available on the election of the right holder; or additional damages.113

8. Pre-established damages under paragraphs 6 and 7 shall be set out in an amount that would be sufficient to compensate the right holder for the harm caused by the infringement, and with a view to deterring future infringements. 9. In awarding additional damages under paragraphs 6 and 7, judicial authorities shall have the authority to award such additional damages as they consider appropriate, having regard to all relevant matters, including the nature of the infringing conduct and the need to deter similar infringements in the future. 10. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities, if appropriate, have the authority to order, at the conclusion of civil judicial proceedings concerning infringement of at least copyright or related rights, patents and trademarks, that the prevailing party be awarded payment by the losing party of court costs or fees and appropriate attorney's fees, or any other expenses as provided for under the Party's law. 11. If a Party's judicial or other authorities appoint a technical or other expert in a civil proceeding concerning the enforcement of an intellectual property right and require that the parties to the proceeding pay the costs of that expert, that Party should seek to ensure that those costs are reasonable and related appropriately, among other things, to the quantity and nature of work to be performed and do not unreasonably deter recourse to such proceedings. 12. Each Party shall provide that in civil judicial proceedings: (a) at least with respect to pirated copyright goods and counterfeit trademark goods, its judicial authorities have the authority, at the right holder's request, to order that the infringing goods be destroyed, except in exceptional circumstances, without compensation of any sort;

112

For greater certainty, additional damages may include exemplary or punitive damages. For greater certainty, additional damages may include exemplary or punitive damages.

113

18-45

(b)

its judicial authorities have the authority to order that materials and implements that have been used in the manufacture or creation of the infringing goods be, without undue delay and without compensation of any sort, destroyed or disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimise the risk of further infringement; and in regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed is not sufficient, other than in exceptional circumstances, to permit the release of goods into the channels of commerce.

(c)

13. Without prejudice to its law governing privilege, the protection of confidentiality of information sources or the processing of personal data, each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of an intellectual property right, its judicial authorities have the authority, on a justified request of the right holder, to order the infringer or, in the alternative, the alleged infringer to provide to the right holder or to the judicial authorities, at least for the purpose of collecting evidence, relevant information as provided for in its applicable laws and regulations that the infringer or alleged infringer possesses or controls. The information may include information regarding any person involved in any aspect of the infringement or alleged infringement and the means of production or the channels of distribution of the infringing or allegedly infringing goods or services, including the identification of third persons alleged to be involved in the production and distribution of the goods or services and of their channels of distribution. 14. Each Party shall provide that in relation to a civil judicial proceeding concerning the enforcement of an intellectual property right, its judicial or other authorities have the authority to impose sanctions on a party, counsel, experts or other persons subject to the court's jurisdiction for violation of judicial orders concerning the protection of confidential information produced or exchanged in that proceeding. 15. Each Party shall ensure that its judicial authorities have the authority to order a party at whose request measures were taken and that has abused enforcement procedures with regard to intellectual property rights, including trademarks, geographical indications, patents, copyright and related rights and industrial designs, to provide to a party wrongfully enjoined or restrained adequate compensation for the injury suffered because of that abuse. The judicial authorities shall also have the authority to order the applicant to pay the defendant expenses, which may include appropriate attorney's fees. 16. To the extent that any civil remedy can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures on the merits of a case, each Party shall provide that

18-46

those procedures conform to principles equivalent in substance to those set out in this Article. 17. In civil judicial proceedings concerning the acts described in Article 18.68 (TPMs) and Article 18.69 (RMI): (a) each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority at least to:114 (i) impose provisional measures, including seizure or other taking into custody of devices and products suspected of being involved in the prohibited activity; order the type of damages available for copyright infringement, as provided under its law in accordance with this Article;115 order court costs, fees or expenses as provided for under paragraph 10; and order the destruction of devices and products found to be involved in the prohibited activity; and

(ii)

(iii) (iv) (b)

a Party may provide that damages shall not be available against a non-profit library, archive, educational institution, museum or public non-commercial broadcasting entity, if it sustains the burden of proving that it was not aware or had no reason to believe that its acts constituted a prohibited activity.

Article 18.75: Provisional Measures 1. Each Party's authorities shall act on a request for relief in respect of an intellectual property right inaudita altera parte expeditiously in accordance with that Party's judicial rules. 2. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to require the applicant for a provisional measure in respect of an intellectual property right to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy the judicial authority, with a sufficient degree of certainty, that the applicant's right is being infringed or that the infringement is imminent, and to order the applicant to
114

For greater certainty, a Party may, but is not required to, put in place separate remedies in respect of Article 18.68 (TPMs) and Article 18.69 (RMI), if those remedies are available under its copyright law.
115

If a Party's copyright law provides for both pre-established damages and additional damages, that Party may comply with the requirements of this subparagraph by providing for only one of these forms of damages.

18-47

provide security or equivalent assurance set at a level sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse. Such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to those procedures. 3. In civil judicial proceedings concerning copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order the seizure or other taking into custody of suspected infringing goods, materials and implements relevant to the infringement, and, at least for trademark counterfeiting, documentary evidence relevant to the infringement. Article 18.76: Special Requirements related to Border Measures 1. Each Party shall provide for applications to suspend the release of, or to detain, any suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark or pirated copyright goods that are imported into the territory of the Party.116 2. Each Party shall provide that any right holder initiating procedures for its competent authorities117 to suspend release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark or pirated copyright goods into free circulation is required to provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the law of the Party providing the procedures, there is prima facie an infringement of the right holder's intellectual property right and to supply sufficient information that may reasonably be expected to be within the right holder's knowledge to make the suspect goods reasonably recognisable by its competent authorities. The requirement to provide that information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. 3. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to require a right holder initiating procedures to suspend the release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark or pirated copyright goods, to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the
116

For the purposes of this Article: (a) counterfeit trademark goods means any goods, including packaging, bearing without authorisation a trademark that is identical to the trademark validly registered in respect of such goods, or that cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from such a trademark, and that thereby infringes the rights of the owner of the trademark in question under the law of the Party providing the procedures under this Section; and

(b) pirated copyright goods means any goods that are copies made without the consent of the right holder or person duly authorised by the right holder in the country of production and that are made directly or indirectly from an article where the making of that copy would have constituted an infringement of a copyright or a related right under the law of the Party providing the procedures under this Section.
117

For the purposes of this Article, unless otherwise specified, competent authorities may include the appropriate judicial, administrative or law enforcement authorities under a Party's law.

18-48

defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse. Each Party shall provide that such security or equivalent assurance does not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. A Party may provide that the security may be in the form of a bond conditioned to hold the defendant harmless from any loss or damage resulting from any suspension of the release of goods in the event the competent authorities determine that the article is not an infringing good. 4. Without prejudice to a Party's law pertaining to privacy or the confidentiality of information: (a) if a Party's competent authorities have detained or suspended the release of goods that are suspected of being counterfeit trademark or pirated copyright goods, that Party may provide that its competent authorities have the authority to inform the right holder without undue delay of the names and addresses of the consignor, exporter, consignee or importer; a description of the goods; the quantity of the goods; and, if known, the country of origin of the goods;118 or if a Party does not provide its competent authority with the authority referred to in subparagraph (a) when suspect goods are detained or suspended from release, it shall provide, at least in cases of imported goods, its competent authorities with the authority to provide the information specified in subparagraph (a) to the right holder normally within 30 working days of the seizure or determination that the goods are counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods.

(b)

5. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities may initiate border measures ex officio119 with respect to goods under customs control120 that are: (a) (b) (c)
118

imported; destined for export;121 or in transit,122, 123

For greater certainty, a Party may establish reasonable procedures to receive or access that information.
119

For greater certainty, that ex officio action does not require a formal complaint from a third party or right holder.
120

For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat "goods under customs control" as meaning goods that are subject to a Party's customs procedures.
121

For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat goods "destined for export" as meaning exported.
122

This subparagraph applies to suspect goods that are in transit from one customs office to another customs office in the Party's territory from which the goods will be exported.

18-49

and that are suspected of being counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods. 6. Each Party shall adopt or maintain a procedure by which its competent authorities may determine within a reasonable period of time after the initiation of the procedures described in paragraph 1, paragraph 5(a), paragraph 5(b) and, if applicable, paragraph 5(c), whether the suspect goods infringe an intellectual property right. 124 If a Party provides administrative procedures for the determination of an infringement, it may also provide its authorities with the authority to impose administrative penalties or sanctions, which may include fines or the seizure of the infringing goods following a determination that the goods are infringing. 7. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to order the destruction of goods following a determination that the goods are infringing. In cases in which the goods are not destroyed, each Party shall ensure that, except in exceptional circumstances, the goods are disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid any harm to the right holder. In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient, other than in exceptional cases, to permit the release of the goods into the channels of commerce. 8. If a Party establishes or assesses, in connection with the procedures described in this Article, an application fee, storage fee or destruction fee, that fee shall not be set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to these procedures. 9. This Article also shall apply to goods of a commercial nature sent in small consignments. A Party may exclude from the application of this Article small quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature contained in travellers' personal luggage.125

123

As an alternative to this subparagraph, a Party shall instead endeavour to provide, if appropriate and with a view to eliminating international trade in counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods, available information to another Party in respect of goods that it has examined without a local consignee and that are transhipped through its territory and destined for the territory of the other Party, to inform that other Party's efforts to identify suspect goods upon arrival in its territory.
124

A Party may comply with the obligation in this Article with respect to a determination that suspect goods under paragraph 5 infringe an intellectual property right through a determination that the suspect goods bear a false trade description.
125

For greater certainty, a Party may also exclude from the application of this Article small quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature sent in small consignments.

18-50

Article 18.77: Criminal Procedures and Penalties 1. Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of wilful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale. In respect of wilful copyright or related rights piracy, "on a commercial scale" includes at least: (a) (b) acts carried out for commercial advantage or financial gain; and significant acts, not carried out for commercial advantage or financial gain, that have a substantial prejudicial impact on the interests of the copyright or related rights holder in relation to the marketplace.126, 127

2. Each Party shall treat wilful importation or exportation of counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods on a commercial scale as unlawful activities subject to criminal penalties.128 3. Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied in cases of wilful importation129 and domestic use, in the course of trade and on a commercial scale, of a label or packaging:130 (a) to which a trademark has been applied without authorisation that is identical to, or cannot be distinguished from, a trademark registered in its territory; and that is intended to be used in the course of trade on goods or in relation to services that are identical to goods or services for which that trademark is registered.

(b)

126

The Parties understand that a Party may comply with subparagraph (b) by addressing such significant acts under its criminal procedures and penalties for non-authorised uses of protected works, performances and phonograms in its law.
127

A Party may provide that the volume and value of any infringing items may be taken into account in determining whether the act has a substantial prejudicial impact on the interests of the copyright or related rights holder in relation to the marketplace.
128

The Parties understand that a Party may comply with its obligation under this paragraph by providing that distribution or sale of counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods on a commercial scale is an unlawful activity subject to criminal penalties. Furthermore, criminal procedures and penalties as specified in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 are applicable in any free trade zones in a Party.
129

A Party may comply with its obligation relating to importation of labels or packaging through its measures concerning distribution.
130

A Party may comply with its obligations under this paragraph by providing for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied to attempts to commit a trademark offence.

18-51

4. Recognising the need to address the unauthorised copying 131 of a cinematographic work from a performance in a movie theatre that causes significant harm to a right holder in the market for that work, and recognising the need to deter such harm, each Party shall adopt or maintain measures, which shall at a minimum include, but need not be limited to, appropriate criminal procedures and penalties. 5. With respect to the offences for which this Article requires a Party to provide for criminal procedures and penalties, each Party shall ensure that criminal liability for aiding and abetting is available under its law. 6. With respect to the offences described in paragraphs 1 through 5, each Party shall provide the following: (a) Penalties that include sentences of imprisonment as well as monetary fines sufficiently high to provide a deterrent to future acts of infringement, consistent with the level of penalties applied for crimes of a corresponding gravity.132 Its judicial authorities have the authority, in determining penalties, to account for the seriousness of the circumstances, which may include circumstances that involve threats to, or effects on, health or safety.133 Its judicial or other competent authorities have the authority to order the seizure of suspected counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods, any related materials and implements used in the commission of the alleged offence, documentary evidence relevant to the alleged offence and assets derived from, or obtained through the alleged infringing activity. If a Party requires identification of items subject to seizure as a prerequisite for issuing a judicial order referred to in this subparagraph, that Party shall not require the items to be described in greater detail than necessary to identify them for the purpose of seizure. Its judicial authorities have the authority to order the forfeiture, at least for serious offences, of any assets derived from or obtained through the infringing activity. Its judicial authorities have the authority to order the forfeiture or destruction of:

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

131

For the purposes of this Article, a Party may treat the term "copying" as synonymous with reproduction.
132

The Parties understand that there is no obligation for a Party to provide for the possibility of imprisonment and monetary fines to be imposed in parallel.
133

A Party may also account for such circumstances through a separate criminal offence.

18-52

(i) (ii)

all counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods; materials and implements that have been predominantly used in the creation of pirated copyright goods or counterfeit trademark goods; and any other labels or packaging to which a counterfeit trademark has been applied and that have been used in the commission of the offence.

(iii)

In cases in which counterfeit trademark goods and pirated copyright goods are not destroyed, the judicial or other competent authorities shall ensure that, except in exceptional circumstances, those goods are disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid causing any harm to the right holder. Each Party shall further provide that forfeiture or destruction under this subparagraph and subparagraph (c) shall occur without compensation of any kind to the defendant. (f) Its judicial or other competent authorities have the authority to release or, in the alternative, provide access to, goods, material, implements, and other evidence held by the relevant authority to a right holder for civil134 infringement proceedings. Its competent authorities may act upon their own initiative to initiate legal action without the need for a formal complaint by a third person or right holder.135

(g)

7. With respect to the offences described in paragraphs 1 through 5, a Party may provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order the seizure or forfeiture of assets, or alternatively, a fine, the value of which corresponds to the assets derived from, or obtained directly or indirectly through, the infringing activity. Article 18.78: Trade Secrets136 1. In the course of ensuring effective protection against unfair competition as provided in Article 10bis of the Paris Convention, each Party shall ensure that
134

A Party may also provide this authority in connection with administrative infringement proceedings.

135

With regard to copyright and related rights piracy provided for under paragraph 1, a Party may limit application of this subparagraph to the cases in which there is an impact on the right holder's ability to exploit the work, performance or phonogram in the market.
136

For greater certainty, this Article is without prejudice to a Party's measures protecting good faith lawful disclosures to provide evidence of a violation of that Party's law.

18-53

persons have the legal means to prevent trade secrets lawfully in their control from being disclosed to, acquired by, or used by others (including state-owned enterprises) without their consent in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices. 137 As used in this Chapter, trade secrets encompass, at a minimum, undisclosed information as provided for in Article 39.2 of the TRIPS Agreement. 2. Subject to paragraph 3, each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties for one or more of the following: (a) (b) (c) the unauthorised and wilful access to a trade secret held in a computer system; the unauthorised and wilful misappropriation 138 of a trade secret, including by means of a computer system; or the fraudulent disclosure, or alternatively, the unauthorised and wilful disclosure, of a trade secret, including by means of a computer system.

3. With respect to the relevant acts referred to in paragraph 2, a Party may, as appropriate, limit the availability of its criminal procedures, or limit the level of penalties available, to one or more of the following cases in which: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) the acts are for the purposes of commercial advantage or financial gain; the acts are related to a product or service in national or international commerce; the acts are intended to injure the owner of such trade secret; the acts are directed by or for the benefit of or in association with a foreign economic entity; or the acts are detrimental to a Party's economic interests, international relations, or national defence or national security.

137

For the purposes of this paragraph "a manner contrary to honest commercial practices" means at least practices such as breach of contract, breach of confidence and inducement to breach, and includes the acquisition of undisclosed information by third parties that knew, or were grossly negligent in failing to know, that those practices were involved in the acquisition.
138

A Party may deem the term "misappropriation" to be synonymous with "unlawful acquisition".

18-54

Article 18.79: Protection of Encrypted Program-Carrying Satellite and Cable Signals 1. Each Party shall make it a criminal offence to: (a) manufacture, assemble, modify, 139 import, export, sell, lease or otherwise distribute a tangible or intangible device or system knowing or having reason to know 140 that the device or system meets at least one of the following conditions: (i) (ii) (iii) it is intended to be used to assist; it is primarily of assistance; or its principal function is solely to assist,

in decoding an encrypted program-carrying satellite signal without the authorisation of the lawful distributor141 of such signal;142 and (b) with respect to an encrypted program-carrying satellite signal, wilfully: (i) (ii) receive143 such a signal; or further distribute144 such signal,

knowing that it has been decoded without the authorisation of the lawful distributor of the signal.

139

For greater certainty, a Party may treat "assemble" and "modify" as incorporated in "manufacture".
140

For the purposes of this paragraph, a Party may provide that "having reason to know" may be demonstrated through reasonable evidence, taking into account the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged illegal act, as part of the Party's "knowledge" requirements. A Party may treat "having reason to know" as meaning "wilful negligence".
141

With regard to the criminal offences and penalties in paragraph 1 and paragraph 3, a Party may require a demonstration of intent to avoid payment to the lawful distributor, or a demonstration of intent to otherwise secure a pecuniary benefit to which the recipient is not entitled.
142

The obligation regarding export may be met by making it a criminal offence to possess and distribute a device or system described in this paragraph. For the purposes of this Article, a Party may provide that a "lawful distributor" means a person that has the lawful right in that Party's territory to distribute the encrypted program-carrying signal and authorise its decoding.
143

For greater certainty and for the purposes of paragraph 1(b) and paragraph 3(b), a Party may provide that wilful receipt of an encrypted program-carrying satellite or cable signal means receipt and use of the signal, or means receipt and decoding of the signal.
144

For greater certainty, a Party may interpret "further distribute" as "retransmit to the public".

18-55

2. Each Party shall provide for civil remedies for a person that holds an interest in an encrypted program-carrying satellite signal or its content and that is injured by an activity described in paragraph 1. 3. Each Party shall provide for criminal penalties or civil remedies145 for wilfully: (a) manufacturing or distributing equipment knowing that the equipment is intended to be used in the unauthorised reception of any encrypted program-carrying cable signal; and receiving, or assisting another to receive,146 an encrypted programcarrying cable signal without authorisation of the lawful distributor of the signal.

(b)

Article 18.80: Government Use of Software 1. Each Party recognises the importance of promoting the adoption of measures to enhance government awareness of respect for intellectual property rights and of the detrimental effects of the infringement of intellectual property rights. 2. Each Party shall adopt or maintain appropriate laws, regulations, policies, orders, government-issued guidelines, or administrative or executive decrees that provide that its central government agencies use only non -infringing computer software protected by copyright and related rights, and, if applicable, only use that computer software in a manner authorised by the relevant licence. These measures shall apply to the acquisition and management of the software for government use.147

145

If a Party provides for civil remedies, it may require a demonstration of injury.

146

A Party may comply with its obligation in respect of "assisting another to receive" by providing for criminal penalties to be available against a person wilfully publishing any information in order to enable or assist another person to receive a signal without authorisation of the lawful distributor of the signal.
147

For greater certainty, paragraph 2 should not be interpreted as encouraging regional government agencies to use infringing computer software or, if applicable, to use computer software in a manner which is not authorised by the relevant licence.

18-56

Section J: Internet Service Providers148 Article 18.81: Definitions For the purposes of this Section: the term copyright includes related rights; and Internet Service Provider means: (a) a provider of online services for the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user's choosing, undertaking the function in Article 18.82.2(a) (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours); or a provider of online services undertaking the functions in Article 18.82.2(c) or Article 18.82.2(d) (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours).

(b)

For greater certainty, Internet Service Provider includes a provider of the services listed above that engages in caching carried out through an automated process. Article 18.82: Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours149 1. The Parties recognise the importance of facilitating the continued development of legitimate online services operating as intermediaries and, in a manner consistent with Article 41 of the TRIPS Agreement, providing enforcement procedures that permit effective action by right holders against copyright infringement covered under this Chapter that occurs in the online environment. Accordingly, each Party shall ensure that legal remedies are available for right holders to address such copyright infringement and shall establish or maintain appropriate safe harbours in respect of online services that are Internet Service Providers. This framework of legal remedies and safe harbours shall include: (a) legal incentives150 for Internet Service Providers to cooperate with copyright owners to deter the unauthorised storage and transmission of copyrighted materials or, in the alternative, to take

Annex 18-F applies to this Section. Annex 18-E applies to Article 18.82.3 and Article 18.82.4 (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours).

149

150

For greater certainty, the Parties understand that implementation of the obligations in paragraph 1(a) on "legal incentives" may take different forms.

other action to deter the unauthorised storage and transmission of copyrighted materials; and (b) limitations in its law that have the effect of precluding monetary relief against Internet Service Providers for copyright infringements that they do not control, initiate or direct, and that take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf.151

2. The limitations described in paragraph 1(b) shall include limitations in respect of the following functions: (a) transmitting, routing or providing connections for material without modification of its content 152 or the intermediate and transient storage of that material done automatically in the course of such a technical process; caching carried out through an automated process; storage153, at the direction of a user, of material residing on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the Internet Service Provider;154 and referring or linking users to an online location by using information location tools, including hyperlinks and directories.

(b) (c)

(d)

3. To facilitate effective action to address infringement, each Party shall prescribe in its law conditions for Internet Service Providers to qualify for the limitations described in paragraph 1(b), or, alternatively, shall provide for circumstances under which Internet Service Providers do not qualify for the limitations described in paragraph 1(b):155, 156
151

The Parties understand that, to the extent that a Party determines, consistent with its international legal obligations, that a particular act does not constitute copyright infringement, there is no obligation to provide for a limitation in relation to that act.
152

The Parties understand that such modification does not include a modification made as part of a technical process or for solely technical reasons such as division into packets.
153

For greater certainty, a Party may interpret "storage" as "hosting".

154

For greater certainty, the storage of material may include e -mails and their attachments stored in the Internet Service Provider's server and web pages residing on the Internet Service Provider's server.
155

A Party may comply with the obligations in paragraph 3 by maintaining a framework in which: (a) there is a stakeholder organisation that includes representatives of both Internet Service Providers and right holders, established with government involvement;

18-58

(a)

With respect to the functions referred to in paragraph 2(c) and paragraph 2(d), these conditions shall include a requirement for Internet Service Providers to expeditiously remove or disable access to material residing on their networks or systems upon obtaining actual knowledge of the copyright infringement or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringement is apparent, such as through receiving a notice157 of alleged infringement from the right holder or a person authorised to act on its behalf, An Internet Service Provider that removes or disables access to material in good faith under subparagraph (a) shall be exempt from any liability for having done so, provided that it takes reasonable steps in advance or promptly after to notify the person whose material is removed or disabled.158

(b)

(b) that stakeholder organisation develops and maintains effective, efficient and timely procedures for entities certified by the stakeholder organisation to verify, without undue delay, the validity of each notice of alleged copyright infringement by confirming that the notice is not the result of mistake or misidentification, before forwarding the verified notice to the relevant Internet Service Provider; (c) there are appropriate guidelines for Internet Service Providers to follow in order to qualify for the limitation described in paragraph 1(b), including requiring that the Internet Service Provider promptly removes or disables access to the identified materials upon receipt of a verified notice; and be exempted from liability for having done so in good faith in accordance with those guidelines; and

(d) there are appropriate measures that provide for liability in cases in which an Internet Service Provider has actual knowledge of the infringement or awareness of facts or circumstances from which the infringement is apparent.
156

The Parties understand that a Party that has yet to implement the obligations in paragraphs 3 and 4 will do so in a manner that is both effective and consistent with that Party's existing constitutional provisions. To that end, a Party may establish an appropriate role for the government that does not impair the timeliness of the process provided in paragraphs 3 and 4, and does not entail advance government review of each individual notice.
157

For greater certainty, a notice of alleged infringement, as may be set out under a Party's law, must contain information that: (a) is reasonably sufficient to enable the Internet Service Provider to identify the work, performance or phonogram claimed to be infringed, the alleged infringing material, and the online location of the alleged infringement; and has a sufficient indicia of reliability with respect to the authority of the person sending the notice.

(b)

158

With respect to the function in subparagraph 2(b), a Party may limit the requirements of paragraph 3 related to an Internet Service Provider removing or disabling access to material to circumstances in which the Internet Service Provider becomes aware or receives notification that the cached material has been removed or access to it has been disabled at the originating site.

18-59

4. If a system for counter-notices is provided under a Party's law, and if material has been removed or access has been disabled in accordance with paragraph 3, that Party shall require that the Internet Service Provider restores the material subject to a counter-notice, unless the person giving the original notice seeks judicial relief within a reasonable period of time. 5. Each Party shall ensure that monetary remedies are available in its legal system against any person that makes a knowing material misrepresentation in a notice or counter-notice that causes injury to any interested party159 as a result of an Internet Service Provider relying on the misrepresentation. 6. Eligibility for the limitations in paragraph 1 shall not be conditioned on the Internet Service Provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity. 7. Each Party shall provide procedures, whether judicial or administrative, in accordance with that Party's legal system, and consistent with principles of due process and privacy, that enable a copyright owner that has made a legally sufficient claim of copyright infringement to obtain expeditiously from an Internet Service Provider information in the provider's possession identifying the alleged infringer, in cases in which that information is sought for the purpose of protecting or enforcing that copyright. 8. The Parties understand that the failure of an Internet Service Provider to qualify for the limitations in paragraph 1(b) does not itself result in liability. Further, this Article is without prejudice to the availability of other limitations and exceptions to copyright, or any other defences under a Party's legal system. 9. The Parties recognise the importance, in implementing their obligations under this Article, of taking into account the impacts on right holders and Internet Service Providers.

Except as otherwise provided in Article 18.10 (Application of Chapter to Existing Subject Matter and Prior Acts) and paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, each Party

Further, if Peru demonstrates that the Andean Community withheld its request for a waiver despite its best efforts, Peru will continue ensuring that it does not discriminate with respect to the availability or enjoyment of patent rights based on the field of technology, the place of invention, and whether products are imported or locally produced. Thus, Peru confirms that the treatment of pharmaceutical patents will be no less favourable than treatment of other patents in respect of the processing and examination of patent applications. Part 2: Applicable to Article 18.50 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.51 (Biologics)

Article 19.4: Non Derogation The Parties recognise that it is inappropriate to encourage trade or investment by weakening or reducing the protections afforded in each Party's labour laws. Accordingly, no Party shall waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, its statutes or regulations: (a) implementing Article 19.3.1 (Labour Rights), if the waiver or derogation would be inconsistent with a right set out in that paragraph; or implementing Article 19.3.1 (Labour Rights) or Article 19.3.2 , if the waiver or derogation would weaken or reduce adherence to a right set out in Article 19.3.1, or to a condition of work referred to in Article 19.3.2, in a special trade or customs area, such as an export processing zone or foreign trade zone, in the Party's territory,

(b)

in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties.

Article 19.5: Enforcement of Labour Laws 1. No Party shall fail to effectively enforce its labour laws through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties after the date of entry into force of this Agreement. 2. If a Party fails to comply with an obligation under this Chapter, a decision made by that Party on the provision of enforcement resources shall not excuse that failure. Each Party retains the right to exercise reasonable enforcement discretion and to make bona fide decisions with regard to the allocation of enforcement resources between labour enforcement activities among the fundamental labour rights and acceptable conditions of work enumerated in Article 19.3.1 (Labour Rights) and Article 19.3.2, provided that the exercise of that discretion, and those decisions, are not inconsistent with its obligations under this Chapter.

5

For greater certainty, this obligation relates to the establishment by a Party in its statutes, regulations and practices thereunder, of acceptable conditions of work as determined by that Party.

19-3

3. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to empower a Party's authorities to undertake labour law enforcement activities in the territory of another Party.

Article 19.6: Forced or Compulsory Labour Each Party recognises the goal of eliminating all forms of forced or compulsory labour, including forced or compulsory child labour. Taking into consideration that the Parties have assumed obligations in this regard under Article 19.3 (Labour Rights), each Party shall also discourage, through initiatives it considers appropriate, the importation of goods from other sources produced in whole or in part by forced or compulsory labour, including forced or compulsory child labour.6

Article 19.7: Corporate Social Responsibility Each Party shall endeavour to encourage enterprises to voluntarily adopt corporate social responsibility initiatives on labour issues that have been endorsed or are supported by that Party.

Article 19.8: Public Awareness and Procedural Guarantees 1. Each Party shall promote public awareness of its labour laws, including by ensuring that information related to its labour laws and enforcement and compliance procedures is publicly available. 2. Each Party shall ensure that persons with a recognised interest under its law in a particular matter have appropriate access to impartial and independent tribunals for the enforcement of the Party's labour laws. These tribunals may include administrative tribunals, quasi-judicial tribunals, judicial tribunals or labour tribunals, as provided for in each Party's law. 3. Each Party shall ensure that proceedings before these tribunals for the enforcement of its labour laws: are fair, equitable and transparent; comply with due process of law; and do not entail unreasonable fees or time limits or unwarranted delays. Any hearings in these proceedings shall be open to the public, except when the administration of justice otherwise requires, and in accordance with its applicable laws. 4.
6

Each Party shall ensure that:

For greater certainty, nothing in this Article authorises a Party to take initiatives that would be inconsistent with its obligations under other provisions of this Agreement, the WTO Agreement or other international trade agreements.

19-4

(a)

the parties to these proceedings are entitled to support or defend their respective positions, including by presenting information or evidence; and final decisions on the merits of the case: (i) are based on information or evidence in respect of which the parties were offered the opportunity to be heard; state the reasons on which they are based; and are available in writing without undue delay to the parties to the proceedings and, consistent with its law, to the public.

(b)

(ii) (iii)

5. Each Party shall provide that parties to these proceedings have the right to seek review or appeal, as appropriate under its law. 6. Each Party shall ensure that the parties to these proceedings have access to remedies under its law for the effective enforcement of their rights under the Party's labour laws and that these remedies are executed in a timely manner. 7. Each Party shall provide procedures to effectively enforce the final decisions of its tribunals in these proceedings. 8. For greater certainty, and without prejudice to whether a tribunal's decision is inconsistent with a Party's obligations under this Chapter, nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to require a tribunal of a Party to reopen a decision that it has made in a particular matter.

Article 19.9: Public Submissions 1. Each Party, through its contact point designated under Article 19.13 (Contact Points), shall provide for the receipt and consideration of written submissions from persons of a Party on matters related to this Chapter in accordance with its domestic procedures. Each Party shall make readily accessible and publicly available its procedures, including timelines, for the receipt and consideration of written submissions. 2. A Party may provide in its procedures that, to be eligible for consideration, a submission should, at a minimum: (a) raise an issue directly relevant to this Chapter;

19-5

(b)

clearly identify the person or organisation making the submission; and explain, to the degree possible, how and to what extent the issue raised affects trade or investment between the Parties.

(c)

3.

Each Party shall: (a) consider matters raised by the submission and provide a timely response to the submitter, including in writing as appropriate; and make the submission and the results of its consideration available to the other Parties and the public, as appropriate, in a timely manner.

(b)

4. A Party may request from the person or organisation that made the submission additional information that is necessary to consider the substance of the submission.
Article 19.10: Cooperation

of the National Assembly or an ordinance of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly that is enforceable by action of the central level of government.

Article 20.2: Objectives 1. The objectives of this Chapter are to promote mutually supportive trade and environmental policies; promote high levels of environmental protection and effective enforcement of environmental laws; and enhance the capacities of the Parties to address trade-related environmental issues, including through cooperation. 2. Taking account of their respective national priorities and circumstances, the Parties recognise that enhanced cooperation to protect and conserve the environment and sustainably manage their natural resources brings benefits that can contribute to sustainable development, strengthen their environmental governance and complement the objectives of this Agreement. 3. The Parties further recognise that it is inappropriate to establish or use their environmental laws or other measures in a manner which would constitute a disguised restriction on trade or investment between the Parties.

Article 20.3: General Commitments 1. The Parties recognise the importance of mutually supportive trade and environmental policies and practices to improve environmental protection in the furtherance of sustainable development. 2. The Parties recognise the sovereign right of each Party to establish its own levels of domestic environmental protection and its own environmental priorities, and to establish, adopt or modify its environmental laws and policies accordingly. 3. Each Party shall strive to ensure that its environmental laws and policies provide for, and encourage, high levels of environmental protection and to continue to improve its respective levels of environmental protection. 4. No Party shall fail to effectively enforce its environmental laws through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties, after the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party. 5. The Parties recognise that each Party retains the right to exercise discretion and to make decisions regarding: (a) investigatory, prosecutorial, regulatory and compliance matters; and (b) the allocation of environmental enforcement resources with respect to other environmental laws determined to

20-3

have higher priorities. Accordingly, the Parties understand that with respect to the enforcement of environmental laws a Party is in compliance with paragraph 4 if a course of action or inaction reflects a reasonable exercise of that discretion, or results from a bona fide decision regarding the allocation of those resources in accordance with priorities for enforcement of its environmental laws. 6. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, the Parties recognise that it is inappropriate to encourage trade or investment by weakening or reducing the protection afforded in their respective environmental laws. Accordingly, a Party shall not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, its environmental laws in a manner that weakens or reduces the protection afforded in those laws in order to encourage trade or investment between the Parties. 7. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to empower a Party's authorities to undertake environmental law enforcement activities in the territory of another Party.

Article 20.4: Multilateral Environmental Agreements 1. The Parties recognise that multilateral environmental agreements to which they are party play an important role, globally and domestically, in protecting the environment and that their respective implementation of these agreements is critical to achieving the environmental objectives of these agreements. Accordingly, each Party affirms its commitment to implement the multilateral environmental agreements to which it is a party. 2. The Parties emphasise the need to enhance the mutual supportiveness between trade and environmental law and policies, through dialogue between the Parties on trade and environmental issues of mutual interest, particularly with respect to the negotiation and implementation of relevant multilateral environmental agreements and trade agreements.

Article 20.5: Protection of the Ozone Layer 1. The Parties recognise that emissions of certain substances can significantly deplete and otherwise modify the ozone layer in a manner that is likely to result in adverse effects on human health and the environment. Accordingly, each Party shall take measures to control the production and consumption of, and trade in, such substances.3, 4, 5
3

For greater certainty, for each Party, this provision pertains to substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, done at Montreal, September 16, 1987 (Montreal Protocol), including any future amendments thereto, as applicable to it.

20-4

2. The Parties also recognise the importance of public participation and consultation, in accordance with their respective law or policy, in the development and implementation of measures concerning the protection of the ozone layer. Each Party shall make publicly available appropriate information about its programmes and activities, including cooperative programmes, that are related to ozone layer protection. 3. Consistent with Article 20.12 (Cooperation Frameworks), the Parties shall cooperate to address matters of mutual interest related to ozone-depleting substances. Cooperation may include, but is not limited to exchanging information and experiences in areas related to: (a) environmentally substances; friendly alternatives to ozone-depleting

(b) (c) (d)

refrigerant management practices, policies and programmes; methodologies for stratospheric ozone measurements; and combating illegal trade in ozone-depleting substances.

4

A Party shall be deemed in compliance with this provision if it maintains the measure or measures listed in Annex 20-A implementing its obligations under the Montreal Protocol or any subsequent measure or measures that provide an equivalent or higher level of environmental protection as the measure or measures listed.

5

If compliance with this provision is not established pursuant to footnote 4, to establish a violation of this provision, a Party must demonstrate that the other Party has failed to take measures to control the production and consumption of, and trade in, certain substances that can significantly deplete and otherwise modify the ozone layer in a manner that is likely to result in adverse effects on human health and the environment, in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties.

20-5

Article 20.6: Protection of the Marine Environment from Ship Pollution 1. The Parties recognise the importance of protecting and preserving the marine environment. To that end, each Party shall take measures to prevent the pollution of the marine environment from ships.6, 7, 8 2. The Parties also recognise the importance of public participation and consultation, in accordance with their respective law or policy, in the development and implementation of measures to prevent the pollution of the marine environment from ships. Each Party shall make publicly available appropriate information about its programmes and activities, including cooperative programmes, that are related to the prevention of pollution of the marine environment from ships. 3. Consistent with Article 20.12 (Cooperation Frameworks), the Parties shall cooperate to address matters of mutual interest with respect to pollution of the marine environment from ships. Areas of cooperation may include: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) accidental pollution from ships; pollution from routine operations of ships; deliberate pollution from ships; development of technologies to minimise ship-generated waste; emissions from ships; adequacy of port waste reception facilities; increased protection in special geographic areas; and

6

For greater certainty, for each Party, this provision pertains to pollution regulated by the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, done at London, November 2, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, done at London, February 17, 1978, and the Protocol of 1997 to Amend the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 as Modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto, done at London, September 26, 1997 (MARPOL), including any future amendments thereto, as applicable to it. A Party shall be deemed in compliance with this provision if it maintains the measure or measures listed in Annex 20-B implementing its obligations under MARPOL, or any subsequent measure or measures that provide an equivalent or higher level of environmental protection as the measure or measures listed.

7

8

If compliance with this provision is not established pursuant to footnote 7, to establish a violation of this provision, a Party must demonstrate that the other Party has failed to take measures to prevent the pollution of the marine environment from ships in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties.

Each Party shall ensure that judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative proceedings for the enforcement of its environmental laws are available under its law and that those proceedings are fair, equitable, transparent and comply with due process of law. Any hearings in these proceedings shall be open to the public, except when the administration of justice otherwise requires, and in accordance with its applicable laws. 4. Each Party shall ensure that persons with a recognised interest under its law in a particular matter have appropriate access to proceedings referred to in paragraph 3. 5. Each Party shall provide appropriate sanctions or remedies for violations of its environmental laws for the effective enforcement of those laws. Those sanctions or remedies may include a right to bring an action directly against the violator to seek damages or injunctive relief, or a right to seek governmental action. 6. Each Party shall ensure that it takes appropriate account of relevant factors in the establishment of the sanctions or remedies referred to in paragraph 5. Those factors may include the nature and gravity of the violation, damage to the environment and any economic benefit the violator derived from the violation.

Article 20.8: Opportunities for Public Participation 1. Each Party shall seek to accommodate requests for information regarding the Party's implementation of this Chapter. 2. Each Party shall make use of existing, or establish new, consultative mechanisms, for example national advisory committees, to seek views on matters related to the implementation of this Chapter. These mechanisms may include

20-7

persons with relevant experience, as appropriate, including experience in business, natural resource conservation and management, or other environmental matters.

Article 20.9: Public Submissions 1. Each Party shall provide for the receipt and consideration of written submissions from persons of that Party regarding its implementation of this Chapter.9 Each Party shall respond in a timely manner to such submissions in writing and in accordance with domestic procedures, and make the submissions and its responses available to the public, for example by posting on an appropriate public website. 2. Each Party shall make its procedures for the receipt and consideration of written submissions readily accessible and publicly available, for example by posting on an appropriate public website.

If available and appropriate, a Party may use an existing institutional body or mechanism for this purpose.

20-8

(Committee) discuss that submission and written response with a view to further understanding the matter raised in the submission and, as appropriate, to consider whether the matter could benefit from cooperative activities. 5. At its first meeting, the Committee shall establish procedures for discussing submissions and responses that are referred to it by a Party. These procedures may provide for the use of experts or existing institutional bodies to develop a report for the Committee comprised of information based on facts relevant to the matter. 6. No later than three years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, and thereafter as decided by the Parties, the Committee shall prepare a written report for the Commission on the implementation of this Article. For the purposes of preparing this report, each Party shall provide a written summary regarding its implementation activities under this Article.

Article 20.10: Corporate Social Responsibility Each Party should encourage enterprises operating within its territory or jurisdiction, to adopt voluntarily, into their policies and practices, principles of corporate social responsibility that are related to the environment, consistent with internationally recognised standards and guidelines that have been endorsed or are supported by that Party.

Article 20.11: Voluntary Mechanisms to Enhance Environmental Performance 1. The Parties recognise that flexible, voluntary mechanisms, for example, voluntary auditing and reporting, market-based incentives, voluntary sharing of information and expertise, and public-private partnerships, can contribute to the achievement and maintenance of high levels of environmental protection and complement domestic regulatory measures. The Parties also recognise that those mechanisms should be designed in a manner that maximises their environmental benefits and avoids the creation of unnecessary barriers to trade. 2. Therefore, in accordance with its laws, regulations or policies and to the extent it considers appropriate, each Party shall encourage: (a) the use of flexible and voluntary mechanisms to protect natural resources and the environment in its territory; and its relevant authorities, businesses and business organisations, nongovernmental organisations and other interested persons involved in the development of criteria used to evaluate environmental performance, with respect to these voluntary mechanisms, to continue to develop and improve such criteria.

(b)

20-9

3. Further, if private sector entities or non-governmental organisations develop voluntary mechanisms for the promotion of products based on their environmental qualities, each Party should encourage those entities and organisations to develop voluntary mechanisms that, among other things: (a) are truthful, are not misleading and take into account scientific and technical information; if applicable and available, are based on relevant international standards, recommendations or guidelines, and best practices; promote competition and innovation; and do not treat a product less favourably on the basis of origin.

(b)

(c) (d)

Article 20.12: Cooperation Frameworks 1. The Parties recognise the importance of cooperation as a mechanism to implement this Chapter, to enhance its benefits and to strengthen the Parties' joint and individual capacities to protect the environment and to promote sustainable development as they strengthen their trade and investment relations. 2. Taking account of their national priorities and circumstances, and available resources, the Parties shall cooperate to address matters of joint or common interest among the participating Parties related to the implementation of this Chapter, when there is mutual benefit from that cooperation. This cooperation may be carried out on a bilateral or plurilateral basis between Parties and, subject to consensus by the participating Parties, may include nongovernmental bodies or organisations and non-Parties to this Agreement. 3. Each Party shall designate the authority or authorities responsible for cooperation related to the implementation of this Chapter to serve as its national contact point on matters that relate to coordination of cooperation activities and shall notify the other Parties in writing within 90 days of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party of its contact point. On notifying the other Parties of its contact point, or at any time thereafter through the contact points, a Party may: (a) share its priorities for cooperation with the other Parties, including the objectives of that cooperation; and propose cooperation activities related to the implementation of this Chapter to another Party or Parties.

(b)

20-10

4. When possible and appropriate, the Parties shall seek to complement and use their existing cooperation mechanisms and take into account relevant work of regional and international organisations. 5. Cooperation may be undertaken through various means including: dialogues, workshops, seminars, conferences, collaborative programmes and projects; technical assistance to promote and facilitate cooperation and training; the sharing of best practices on policies and procedures; and the exchange of experts. 6. In developing cooperative activities and programmes, a Party shall, if relevant, identify performance measures and indicators to assist in examining and evaluating the efficiency, effectiveness and progress of specific cooperative activities and programmes and share those measures and indicators, as well as the outcome of any evaluation during or following the completion of a cooperative activity or programme, with the other Parties. 7. The Parties, through their contact points for cooperation, shall periodically review the implementation and operation of this Article and report their findings, which may include recommendations, to the Committee to inform its review under Article 20.19(3)(c) (Environment Committee and Contact Points). The Parties, through the Committee, may periodically evaluate the necessity of designating an entity to provide administrative and operational support for cooperative activities. If the Parties decide to establish such an entity, the Parties shall agree on the funding of the entity on a voluntary basis to support the entity's operation. 8. Each Party shall promote public participation in the development and implementation of cooperative activities, as appropriate. This may include activities such as encouraging and facilitating direct contacts and cooperation among relevant entities and the conclusion of arrangements among them for the conduct of cooperative activities under this Chapter. 9. Where a Party has defined the environmental laws under Article 20.1 (Definitions) to include only laws at the central level of government (first Party), and where another Party (second Party) considers that an environmental law at the sub-central level of government of the first Party is not being effectively enforced by the relevant sub-central government through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties, the second Party may request a dialogue with the first Party. The request shall contain information that is specific and sufficient to enable the first Party to evaluate the matter at issue and an indication of how the matter is negatively affecting trade or investment of the second Party. 10. All cooperative activities under this Chapter are subject to the availability of funds and of human and other resources, and to the applicable laws and regulations

20-11

of the participating Parties. The participating Parties shall decide, on a case-by-case basis, the funding of cooperative activities.

Article 20.13: Trade and Biodiversity 1. The Parties recognise the importance of conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and their key role in achieving sustainable development. 2. Accordingly, each Party shall promote and encourage the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, in accordance with its law or policy. 3. The Parties recognise the importance of respecting, preserving and maintaining knowledge and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles that contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. 4. The Parties recognise the importance of facilitating access to genetic resources within their respective national jurisdictions, consistent with each Party's international obligations. The Parties further recognise that some Parties require, through national measures, prior informed consent to access such genetic resources in accordance with national measures and, where such access is granted, the establishment of mutually agreed terms, including with respect to sharing of benefits from the use of such genetic resources, between users and providers. 5. The Parties also recognise the importance of public participation and consultation, in accordance with their respective law or policy, in the development and implementation of measures concerning the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. Each Party shall make publicly available information about its programmes and activities, including cooperative programmes, related to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. 6. Consistent with Article 20.12 (Cooperation Frameworks), the Parties shall cooperate to address matters of mutual interest. Cooperation may include, but is not limited to, exchanging information and experiences in areas related to: (a) (b) (c) the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity; the protection and maintenance of ecosystems and ecosystem services; and access to genetic resources and the sharing of benefits arising from their utilisation.

Article 20.14: Invasive Alien Species 1. The Parties recognise that the movement of terrestrial and aquatic invasive alien species across borders through trade-related pathways can adversely affect

20-12

the environment, economic activities and development, and human health. The Parties also recognise that the prevention, detection, control and, when possible, eradication, of invasive alien species are critical strategies for managing those adverse impacts. 2. Accordingly, the Committee shall coordinate with the Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures established under Article 7.5 (Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures) to identify cooperative opportunities to share information and management experiences on the movement, prevention, detection, control and eradication of invasive alien species, with a view to enhancing efforts to assess and address the risks and adverse impacts of invasive alien species.

Article 20.15: Transition to a Low Emissions and Resilient Economy 1. The Parties acknowledge that transition to a low emissions economy requires collective action. 2. The Parties recognise that each Party's actions to transition to a low emissions economy should reflect domestic circumstances and capabilities and, consistent with Article 20.12 (Cooperation Frameworks), Parties shall cooperate to address matters of joint or common interest. Areas of cooperation may include, but are not limited to: energy efficiency; development of cost-effective, low emissions technologies and alternative, clean and renewable energy sources; sustainable transport and sustainable urban infrastructure development; addressing deforestation and forest degradation; emissions monitoring; market and nonmarket mechanisms; low emissions, resilient development and sharing of information and experiences in addressing this issue. Further, the Parties shall, as appropriate, engage in cooperative and capacity-building activities related to transitioning to a low emissions economy. Article 20.16: Marine Capture Fisheries10 1. The Parties acknowledge their role as major consumers, producers and traders of fisheries products and the importance of the marine fisheries sector to their development and to the livelihoods of their fishing communities, including artisanal or small-scale fisheries. The Parties also acknowledge that the fate of marine capture fisheries is an urgent resource problem facing the international community. Accordingly, the Parties recognise the importance of taking measures aimed at the conservation and the sustainable management of fisheries.

10

For greater certainty, this Article does not apply with respect to aquaculture.

20-13

2. In this regard, the Parties acknowledge that inadequate fisheries management, fisheries subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity, and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing11 can have significant negative impacts on trade, development and the environment and recognise the need for individual and collective action to address the problems of overfishing and unsustainable utilisation of fisheries resources. 3. Accordingly, each Party shall seek to operate a fisheries management system that regulates marine wild capture fishing and that is designed to: (a) (b) prevent overfishing and overcapacity; reduce bycatch of non-target species and juveniles, including through the regulation of fishing gear that results in bycatch and the regulation of fishing in areas where bycatch is likely to occur; and promote the recovery of overfished stocks for all marine fisheries in which that Party's persons conduct fishing activities.

(c)

Such a management system shall be based on the best scientific evidence available and on internationally recognised best practices for fisheries management and conservation as reflected in the relevant provisions of international instruments aimed at ensuring the sustainable use and conservation of marine species.12 4. Each Party shall promote the long-term conservation of sharks, marine turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals, through the implementation and effective enforcement of conservation and management measures. Such measures should include, as appropriate: (a) for sharks: the collection of species specific data, fisheries bycatch mitigation measures, catch limits, and finning prohibitions; and

11

The term "illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing" is to be understood to have the same meaning as paragraph 3 of the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (2001 IUU Fishing Plan of Action) of the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), adopted in Rome, 2001. These instruments include, among others, and as they may apply, UNCLOS, the United Nations Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, done at New York, December 4, 1995 (UN Fish Stocks Agreement), the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, the 1993 FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas, (Compliance Agreement) done at Rome, November 24, 1993 and the 2001 IUU Fishing Plan of Action.

12

20-14

(b)

for marine turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals: fisheries bycatch mitigation measures, conservation and relevant management measures, prohibitions, and other measures in accordance with relevant international agreements to which the Party is party.

5. The Parties recognise that the implementation of a fisheries management system that is designed to prevent overfishing and overcapacity and to promote the recovery of overfished stocks must include the control, reduction and eventual elimination of all subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity. To that end, no Party shall grant or maintain any of the following subsidies13 within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement that are specific within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement: (a) subsidies for fishing14 that negatively affect15 fish stocks that are in an overfished16 condition; and subsidies provided to any fishing vessel17 while listed by the flag State or a relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisation or Arrangement for IUU fishing in accordance with the rules and procedures of that organisation or arrangement and in conformity with international law.

(b)

6. Subsidy programmes that are established by a Party before the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party and which are inconsistent with paragraph 5(a) shall be brought into conformity with that paragraph as soon as

13

For the purposes of this Article, a subsidy shall be attributable to the Party conferring it, regardless of the flag of the vessel involved or the application of rules of origin to the fish involved. For the purposes of this paragraph, "fishing" means searching for, attracting, locating, catching, taking or harvesting fish or any activity which can reasonably be expected to result in the attracting, locating, catching, taking or harvesting of fish. The negative effect of such subsidies shall be determined based on the best scientific evidence available.

14

15

For the purposes of this Article, a fish stock is overfished if the stock is at such a low level that mortality from fishing needs to be restricted to allow the stock to rebuild to a level that produces maximum sustainable yield or alternative reference points based on the best scientific evidence available. Fish stocks that are recognised as overfished by the national jurisdiction where the fishing is taking place or by a relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisation shall also be considered overfished for the purposes of this paragraph.
17

16

The term "fishing vessels" refers to any vessel, ship or other type of boat used for, equipped to be used for, or intended to be used for fishing or fishing related activities.

20-15

possible and no later than three years18 of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party. 7. In relation to subsidies that are not prohibited by paragraph 5(a) or 5(b), and taking into consideration a Party's social and developmental priorities, including food security concerns, each Party shall make best efforts to refrain from introducing new, or extending or enhancing existing, subsidies within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement, to the extent they are specific within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement, that contribute to overfishing or overcapacity. 8. With a view to achieving the objective of eliminating subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity, the Parties shall review the disciplines in paragraph 5 at regular meetings of the Committee. 9. Each Party shall notify the other Parties, within one year of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for it and every two years thereafter, of any subsidy within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement that is specific within the meaning of Article 2 of the SCM Agreement, that the Party grants or maintains to persons engaged in fishing or fishing related activities. 10. These notifications shall cover subsidies provided within the previous twoyear period and shall include the information required under Article 25.3 of the SCM Agreement and, to the extent possible, the following information:19 (a) (b) (c) programme name; legal authority for the programme; catch data by species in the fishery for which the subsidy is provided;

18

Notwithstanding this paragraph, and solely for the purpose of completing a stock assessment that it has already initiated, Viet Nam may request an extension of two additional years to bring any subsidy programmes into conformity with Article 20.16.5(a) (Marine Capture Fisheries) by providing a written request to the Committee no later than six months before the expiry of the three-year period provided for in this paragraph. Viet Nam's request shall include the reason for the requested extension and the information about its subsidy programmes as provided for in Article 20.16.10. Viet Nam may avail itself of this one-time extension upon providing a request in accordance with this footnote unless the Committee decides otherwise within 60 days of receiving the request. No later than the date on which the additional two-year period expires, Viet Nam shall provide to the Committee in writing a report on the measures it has taken to fulfil its obligation under Article 20.16.5(a). Sharing information and data on existing fisheries subsidy programmes does not prejudge their legal status, effects or nature under the GATT 1994 or the SCM Agreement and is intended to complement WTO data reporting requirements.

19

20-16

(d)

status of the fish stocks in the fishery for which the subsidy is provided (for example, overexploited, depleted, fully exploited, recovering or underexploited); fleet capacity in the fishery for which the subsidy is provided; conservation and management measures in place for the relevant fish stock; and total imports and exports per species.

(e) (f)

(g)

11. Each Party shall also provide, to the extent possible, information in relation to other fisheries subsidies that the Party grants or maintains that are not covered by paragraph 5, in particular fuel subsidies. 12. A Party may request additional information from the notifying Party regarding the notifications under paragraphs 9 and 10. The notifying Party shall respond to that request as quickly as possible and in a comprehensive manner. 13. The Parties recognise the importance of concerted international action to address IUU fishing as reflected in regional and international instruments20 and shall endeavour to improve cooperation internationally in this regard, including with and through competent international organisations. 14. In support of efforts to combat IUU fishing practices and to help deter trade in products from species harvested from those practices, each Party shall: (a) cooperate with other Parties to identify needs and to build capacity to support the implementation of this Article; support monitoring, control, surveillance, compliance and enforcement systems, including by adopting, reviewing, or revising, as appropriate measures to: (i) deter vessels that are flying its flag and its nationals from engaging in IUU fishing activities; and address the transhipment at sea of fish or fish products caught through IUU fishing activities;

(b)

(ii)

20

Regional and international instruments include, among others, and as they may apply, the 2001 IUU Fishing Plan of Action, the 2005 Rome Declaration on IUU Fishing, adopted in Rome on March 12, 2005, the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, done at Rome, November 22, 2009, as well as instruments establishing and adopted by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, which are defined as intergovernmental fisheries organisations or arrangements, as appropriate, that have the competence to establish conservation and management measures.

20-17

(c) (d)

implement port State measures; strive to act consistently with relevant conservation and management measures adopted by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations of which it is not a member so as not to undermine those measures; and endeavour not to undermine catch or trade documentation schemes operated by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations or Arrangements or an intergovernmental organisation whose scope includes the management of shared fisheries resources, including straddling and highly migratory species, where that Party is not a member of those organisations or arrangements.

(e)

15. Consistent with Article 26.2.2 (Publication), a Party shall, to the extent possible, provide other Parties the opportunity to comment on proposed measures that are designed to prevent trade in fisheries products that results from IUU fishing.

Article 20.17: Conservation and Trade 1. The Parties affirm the importance of combating the illegal take21 of, and illegal trade in, wild fauna and flora, and acknowledge that this trade undermines efforts to conserve and sustainably manage those natural resources, has social consequences, distorts legal trade in wild fauna and flora, and reduces the economic and environmental value of these natural resources. 2. Accordingly, each Party shall adopt, maintain and implement laws, regulations and any other measures to fulfil its obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).22, 23, 24
21

The term "take" means captured, killed or collected and with respect to a plant, also means harvested, cut, logged or removed.

22

For the purposes of this Article, a Party's CITES obligations include existing and future amendments to which it is a Party and any existing and future reservations, exemptions, and exceptions applicable to it. To establish a violation of this paragraph, a Party must demonstrate that the other Party has failed to adopt, maintain or implement laws, regulations or other measures to fulfil its obligations under CITES in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties. If a Party considers that another Party is failing to comply with its obligations under this paragraph, it shall endeavour, in the first instance, to address the matter through a consultative or other procedure under CITES.

23

24

20-18

3. The Parties commit to promote conservation and to combat the illegal take of, and illegal trade in, wild fauna and flora. To that end, the Parties shall: (a) exchange information and experiences on issues of mutual interest related to combating the illegal take of, and illegal trade in, wild fauna and flora, including combating illegal logging and associated illegal trade, and promoting the legal trade in associated products; undertake, as appropriate, joint activities on conservation issues of mutual interest, including through relevant regional and international fora; and endeavour to implement, as appropriate, CITES resolutions that aim to protect and conserve species whose survival is threatened by international trade.

(b)

(c)

4.

Each Party further commits to: (a) take appropriate measures to protect and conserve wild fauna and flora that it has identified to be at risk within its territory, including measures to conserve the ecological integrity of specially protected natural areas, for example wetlands; maintain or strengthen government capacity and institutional frameworks to promote sustainable forest management and wild fauna and flora conservation, and endeavour to enhance public participation and transparency in these institutional frameworks; and endeavour to develop and strengthen cooperation and consultation with interested non-governmental entities in order to enhance implementation of measures to combat the illegal take of, and illegal trade in, wild fauna and flora.

(b)

(c)

5. In a further effort to address the illegal take of, and illegal trade in, wild fauna and flora, including parts and products thereof, each Party shall take measures to combat, and cooperate to prevent, the trade of wild fauna and flora that, based on credible evidence25, were taken or traded in violation of that Party's law or another applicable law26, the primary purpose of which is to conserve,
25

For greater certainty, for the purposes of this paragraph, each Party retains the right to determine what constitutes "credible evidence". For greater certainty, "another applicable law" means a law of the jurisdiction where the take or trade occurred and is only relevant to the question of whether the wild fauna and flora has been taken or traded in violation of that law.

26

20-19

protect, or manage wild fauna or flora. Such measures shall include sanctions, penalties, or other effective measures, including administrative measures, that can act as a deterrent to such trade. In addition, each Party shall endeavour to take measures to combat the trade of wild fauna and flora transhipped through its territory that, based on credible evidence, were illegally taken or traded. 6. The Parties recognise that each Party retains the right to exercise administrative, investigatory and enforcement discretion in its implementation of paragraph 5, including by taking into account in relation to each situation the strength of the available evidence and the seriousness of the suspected violation. In addition, the Parties recognise that in implementing paragraph 5, each Party retains the right to make decisions regarding the allocation of administrative, investigatory and enforcement resources. 7. In order to promote the widest measure of law enforcement cooperation and information sharing between the Parties to combat the illegal take of, and illegal trade in, wild fauna and flora, the Parties shall endeavour to identify opportunities, consistent with their respective law and in accordance with applicable international agreements, to enhance law enforcement cooperation and information sharing, for example by creating and participating in law enforcement networks.

Article 20.18: Environmental Goods and Services 1. The Parties recognise the importance of trade and investment in environmental goods and services as a means of improving environmental and economic performance and addressing global environmental challenges. 2. The Parties further recognise the importance of this Agreement to promoting trade and investment in environmental goods and services in the free trade area. 3. Accordingly, the Committee shall consider issues identified by a Party or Parties related to trade in environmental goods and services, including issues identified as potential non-tariff barriers to that trade. The Parties shall endeavour to address any potential barriers to trade in environmental goods and services that may be identified by a Party, including by working through the Committee and in conjunction with other relevant committees established under this Agreement, as appropriate. 4. The Parties may develop bilateral and plurilateral cooperative projects on environmental goods and services to address current and future global traderelated environmental challenges.

20-20

Article 20.19: Environment Committee and Contact Points 1. Each Party shall designate and notify a contact point from its relevant authorities within 90 days of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for it, in order to facilitate communication between the Parties in the implementation of this Chapter. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Parties in the event of any change to its contact point. 2. The Parties establish an Environment Committee (Committee) composed of senior government representatives, or their designees, of the relevant trade and environment national authorities of each Party responsible for the implementation of this Chapter. 3. The purpose of the Committee is to oversee the implementation of this Chapter and its functions shall be to: (a) provide a forum to discuss and review the implementation of this Chapter; provide periodic reports to the Commission regarding the implementation of this Chapter; provide a forum to discuss and review cooperative activities under this Chapter; consider and endeavour to resolve matters referred to it under Article 20.21 (Senior Representative Consultations); coordinate with other committees established under this Agreement as appropriate; and perform any other functions as the Parties may decide.

4. The Committee shall meet within one year of the date of entry into force of this Agreement. Thereafter, the Committee shall meet every two years unless the Committee agrees otherwise. The Chair of the Committee and the venue of its meetings shall rotate among each of the Parties in English alphabetical order, unless the Committee agrees otherwise. 5. All decisions and reports of the Committee shall be made by consensus, unless the Committee agrees otherwise or unless otherwise provided in this Chapter. 6. All decisions and reports of the Committee shall be made available to the public, unless the Committee agrees otherwise. 7. During the fifth year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the Committee shall:

20-21

(a) (b)

review the implementation and operation of this Chapter; report its findings, which may include recommendations, to the Parties and the Commission; and undertake subsequent reviews at intervals to be decided by the Parties.

(c)

8. The Committee shall provide for public input on matters relevant to the Committee's work, as appropriate, and shall hold a public session at each meeting. 9. The Parties recognise the importance of resource efficiency in the implementation of this Chapter and the desirability of using new technologies to facilitate communication and interaction between the Parties and with the public.

Article 20.20: Environment Consultations 1. The Parties shall at all times endeavour to agree on the interpretation and application of this Chapter, and shall make every effort through dialogue, consultation, exchange of information and, if appropriate, cooperation to address any matter that might affect the operation of this Chapter. 2. A Party (the requesting Party) may request consultations with any other Party (the responding Party) regarding any matter arising under this Chapter by delivering a written request to the responding Party's contact point. The requesting Party shall include information that is specific and sufficient to enable the responding Party to respond, including identification of the matter at issue and an indication of the legal basis for the request. The requesting Party shall circulate its request for consultations to the other Parties through their respective contact points. 3. A Party other than the requesting or the responding Party that considers it has a substantial interest in the matter (a participating Party) may participate in the consultations by delivering a written notice to the contact point of the requesting and responding Parties no later than seven days after the date of circulation of the request for consultations. The participating Party shall include in its notice an explanation of its substantial interest in the matter. 4. Unless the requesting and the responding Parties (the consulting Parties) agree otherwise, the consulting Parties shall enter into consultations promptly, and no later than 30 days after the date of receipt by the responding Party of the request.

20-22

5. The consulting Parties shall make every effort to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution to the matter, which may include appropriate cooperative activities. The consulting Parties may seek advice or assistance from any person or body they deem appropriate in order to examine the matter.

Article 20.21: Senior Representative Consultations 1. If the consulting Parties have failed to resolve the matter under Article 20.20 (Environment Consultations), a consulting Party may request that the Committee representatives from the consulting Parties convene to consider the matter by delivering a written request to the contact point of the other consulting Party or Parties. At the same time, the consulting Party making the request shall circulate the request to the contact points of other Parties. 2. The Committee representatives from the consulting Parties shall promptly convene following the delivery of the request, and shall seek to resolve the matter including, if appropriate, by gathering relevant scientific and technical information from governmental or non-governmental experts. Committee representatives from any other Party that considers it has a substantial interest in the matter may participate in the consultations.

Article 20.22: Ministerial Consultations 1. If the consulting Parties have failed to resolve the matter under Article 20.21 (Senior Representative Consultations), a consulting Party may refer the matter to the relevant Ministers of the consulting Parties who shall seek to resolve the matter. 2. Consultations pursuant to Article 20.20 (Environment Consultations), Article 20.21 (Senior Representative Consultations) and this Article may be held in person or by any technological means available as agreed by the consulting Parties. If in person, consultations shall be held in the capital of the responding Party, unless the consulting Parties agree otherwise. 3. Consultations shall be confidential and without prejudice to the rights of any Party in any future proceedings.

Article 20.23: Dispute Resolution 1. If the consulting Parties have failed to resolve the matter under Article 20.20 (Environment Consultations), Article 20.21 (Senior Representative Consultations) and Article 20.22 (Ministerial Consultations) within 60 days after the date of receipt of a request under Article 20.20, or any other period as the consulting Parties may agree, the requesting Party may request consultations

20-23

under Article 28.5 (Consultations) or request the establishment of a panel under Article 28.7 (Establishment of a Panel). 2. Notwithstanding Article 28.15 (Role of Experts), in a dispute arising under Article 20.17.2 (Conservation and Trade) a panel convened under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) shall: (a) seek technical advice or assistance, if appropriate, from an entity authorised under CITES to address the particular matter, and provide the consulting Parties with an opportunity to comment on any such technical advice or assistance received; and provide due consideration to any interpretive guidance received pursuant to subparagraph (a) on the matter to the extent appropriate in light of its nature and status in making its findings and determinations under Article 28.17.4 (Initial Report).

(b)

3. Before a Party initiates dispute settlement under this Agreement for a matter arising under Article 20.3.4 (General Commitments) or Article 20.3.6, that Party shall consider whether it maintains environmental laws that are substantially equivalent in scope to the environmental laws that would be the subject of the dispute. 4. If a Party requests consultations with another Party under Article 20.20 (Environment Consultations) for a matter arising under Article 20.3.4 (General Commitments) or Article 20.3.6, and the responding Party considers that the requesting Party does not maintain environmental laws that are substantially equivalent in scope to the environmental laws that would be the subject of the dispute, the Parties shall discuss the issue during the consultations.

Article 25.2: General Provisions 1. For the purposes of this Chapter, regulatory coherence refers to the use of good regulatory practices in the process of planning, designing, issuing, implementing and reviewing regulatory measures in order to facilitate achievement of domestic policy objectives, and in efforts across governments to enhance regulatory cooperation in order to further those objectives and promote international trade and investment, economic growth and employment. 2. The Parties affirm the importance of: (a) sustaining and enhancing the benefits of this Agreement through regulatory coherence in terms of facilitating increased trade in goods and services and increased investment between the Parties; each Party's sovereign right to identify its regulatory priorities and establish and implement regulatory measures to address these priorities, at the levels that the Party considers appropriate; the role that regulation plays in achieving public policy objectives; taking into account input from interested persons in the development of regulatory measures; and developing regulatory cooperation and capacity building between the Parties.

In determining the scope of covered regulatory measures, each Party should aim to achieve significant coverage.

Article 25.4: Coordination and Review Processes or Mechanisms 1. The Parties recognise that regulatory coherence can be facilitated through domestic mechanisms that increase interagency consultation and coordination associated with processes for developing regulatory measures. Accordingly, each Party shall endeavour to ensure that it has processes or mechanisms to facilitate the effective interagency coordination and review of proposed covered regulatory measures. Each Party should consider establishing and maintaining a national or central coordinating body for this purpose. 2. The Parties recognise that while the processes or mechanisms referred to in paragraph 1 may vary between Parties depending on their respective circumstances (including differences in levels of development and political and institutional structures), they should generally have as overarching characteristics the ability to: (a) review proposed covered regulatory measures to determine the extent to which the development of such measures adheres to good regulatory practices, which may include but are not limited to those set out in Article 25.5 (Implementation of Core Good Regulatory Practices), and make recommendations based on that review; strengthen consultation and coordination among domestic agencies so as to identify potential overlap and duplication and to prevent the creation of inconsistent requirements across agencies; make recommendations for systemic regulatory improvements; and publicly report on regulatory measures reviewed, any proposals for systemic regulatory improvements, and any updates on changes to the processes and mechanisms referred to in paragraph 1.

25-2

Article 25.5: Implementation of Core Good Regulatory Practices 1. To assist in designing a measure to best achieve the Party's objective, each Party should generally encourage relevant regulatory agencies, consistent with its laws and regulations, to conduct regulatory impact assessments when developing proposed covered regulatory measures that exceed a threshold of economic impact, or other regulatory impact, where appropriate, as established by the Party. Regulatory impact assessments may encompass a range of procedures to determine possible impacts. 2. Recognising that differences in the Parties' institutional, social, cultural, legal and developmental circumstances may result in specific regulatory approaches, regulatory impact assessments conducted by a Party should, among other things: (a) assess the need for a regulatory proposal, including a description of the nature and significance of the problem; examine feasible alternatives, including, to the extent feasible and consistent with laws and regulations, their costs and benefits, such as risks involved as well as distributive impacts, recognising that some costs and benefits are difficult to quantify and monetise; explain the grounds for concluding that the selected alternative achieves the policy objectives in an efficient manner, including, if appropriate, reference to the costs and benefits and the potential for managing risks; and rely on the best reasonably obtainable existing information including relevant scientific, technical, economic or other information, within the boundaries of the authorities, mandates and resources of the particular regulatory agency.

(b)

(c)

(d)

3. When conducting regulatory impact assessments, a Party may take into consideration the potential impact of the proposed regulation on SMEs. 4. Each Party should ensure that new covered regulatory measures are plainly written and are clear, concise, well organised and easy to understand, recognising that some measures address technical issues and that relevant expertise may be needed to understand and apply them. 5. Subject to its laws and regulations, each Party should ensure that relevant regulatory agencies provide public access to information on new covered regulatory measures and, where practicable, make this information available online.

25-3

6. Each Party should review, at intervals it deems appropriate, its covered regulatory measures to determine whether specific regulatory measures it has implemented should be modified, streamlined, expanded or repealed so as to make the Party's regulatory regime more effective in achieving the Party's policy objectives. 7. Each Party should, in a manner it deems appropriate, and consistent with its laws and regulations, provide annual public notice of any covered regulatory measure that it reasonably expects its regulatory agencies to issue within the following 12-month period. 8. To the extent appropriate and consistent with its law, each Party should encourage its relevant regulatory agencies to consider regulatory measures in other Parties, as well as relevant developments in international, regional and other fora when planning covered regulatory measures.

Article 25.6: Committee on Regulatory Coherence 1. The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Regulatory Coherence (Committee), composed of government representatives of the Parties. 2. The Committee shall consider issues associated with the implementation and operation of this Chapter. The Committee shall also consider identifying future priorities, including potential sectoral initiatives and cooperative activities, involving issues covered by this Chapter and issues related to regulatory coherence covered by other Chapters of this Agreement. 3. In identifying future priorities, the Committee shall take into account the activities of other committees, working groups and any other subsidiary body established under this Agreement and shall coordinate with them in order to avoid duplication of activities. 4. The Committee shall ensure that its work on regulatory cooperation offers value in addition to initiatives underway in other relevant fora and avoids undermining or duplicating such efforts. 5. Each Party shall designate and notify a contact point to provide information, on request by another Party, regarding the implementation of this Chapter in accordance with Article 27.5 (Contact Points). 6.

After taking any steps to protect confidential information, and no later than 15 days after the presentation of the final report, the disputing Parties shall release the final report to the public. 2. No panel shall, either in its initial report or its final report, disclose which panellists are associated with majority or minority opinions.

Article 28.19: Implementation of Final Report 1. The Parties recognise the importance of prompt compliance with determinations made by panels under Article 28.18 (Final Report) in achieving the aim of the dispute settlement procedures in this Chapter, which is to secure a positive solution to disputes. 2. If in its final report the panel determines that: (a) the measure at issue is inconsistent with a Party's obligations in this Agreement; a Party has otherwise failed to carry out its obligations in this Agreement; or the measure at issue is causing nullification or impairment within the meaning of Article 28.3.1(c) (Scope),

(b)

(c)

the responding Party shall, whenever possible, eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment. 3. Unless the disputing Parties agree otherwise, the responding Party shall have a reasonable period of time in which to eliminate the non-conformity or nullification or impairment if it is not practicable to do so immediately.

28-15

4. The disputing Parties shall endeavour to agree on the reasonable period of time. If the disputing Parties fail to agree on the reasonable period of time within a period of 45 days after the presentation of the final report under Article 28.18.1 (Final Report), any disputing Party may, no later than 60 days after the presentation of the final report under Article 28.18.1 (Final Report), refer the matter to the chair to determine the reasonable period of time through arbitration. 5. The chair shall take into consideration as a guideline that the reasonable period of time should not exceed 15 months from the presentation of the final report under Article 28.18.1 (Final Report). However, that time may be shorter or longer, depending upon the particular circumstances. 6. The chair shall determine the reasonable period of time no later than 90 days after the date of referral to the chair under paragraph 4. 7. The disputing Parties may agree to vary the procedures set out in paragraphs 4 through 6 for the determination of the reasonable period of time. Article 28.20: Non-Implementation ­ Compensation and Suspension of Benefits 1. The responding Party shall, if requested by the complaining Party or Parties, enter into negotiations with the complaining Party or Parties no later than 15 days after receipt of that request, with a view to developing mutually acceptable compensation, if: (a) the responding Party has notified the complaining Party or Parties that it does not intend to eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment; or following the expiry of the reasonable period of time established in accordance with Article 28.19 (Implementation of Final Report), there is disagreement between the disputing Parties as to whether the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.

(b)

2. A complaining Party may suspend benefits in accordance with paragraph 3 if that complaining Party and the responding Party have: (a) been unable to agree on compensation within a period of 30 days after the period for developing compensation has begun; or agreed on compensation but the relevant complaining Party considers that the responding Party has failed to observe the terms of the agreement.

(b)

28-16

3. A complaining Party may, at any time after the conditions set out in paragraph 2 are met in relation to that complaining Party, provide written notice to the responding Party that it intends to suspend benefits of equivalent effect. The notice shall specify the level of benefits that the Party proposes to suspend.3 The complaining Party may begin suspending benefits 30 days after the later of the date on which it provides notice under this paragraph or the date that the panel issues its determination under paragraph 5, as the case may be. 4. In considering what benefits to suspend under paragraph 3, the complaining Party shall apply the following principles and procedures: (a) it should first seek to suspend benefits in the same subject matter as that in which the panel has determined non-conformity or nullification or impairment to exist; if it considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same subject matter, and that the circumstances are serious enough, it may suspend benefits in a different subject matter. In the written notice referred to in paragraph 3, the complaining Party shall indicate the reasons on which its decision to suspend benefits in a different subject matter is based; and in applying the principles set out in subparagraphs (a) and (b), it shall take into account: (i) the trade in the good, the supply of the service or other subject matter in which the panel has found the nonconformity or nullification or impairment, and the importance of that trade to the complaining Party; that goods, all financial services covered under Chapter 11 (Financial Services), services other than such financial services, and each section in Chapter 18 (Intellectual Property), are each distinct subject matters; and the broader economic elements related to the nullification or impairment and the broader economic consequences of the suspension of benefits.

(b)

(c)

(ii)

(iii)

5.
3

If the responding Party considers that:

For greater certainty, the phrase "the level of benefits that the Party proposes to suspend" refers to the level of concessions under this Agreement, the suspension of which a complaining Party considers will have an effect equivalent to that of the non-conformity, or nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 28.3.1(c) (Scope), determined to exist by the panel in its final report issued under Article 28.18.1 (Final Report).

28-17

(a)

the level of benefits proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive or the complaining Party has failed to follow the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4; or it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment that the panel has determined to exist,

(b)

it may, within 30 days of the date of delivery of the written notice provided by the complaining Party under paragraph 3, request that the panel be reconvened to consider the matter. The responding Party shall deliver its request in writing to the complaining Party. The panel shall reconvene as soon as possible after the date of delivery of the request and shall present its determination to the disputing Parties no later than 90 days after it reconvenes to review a request under subparagraph (a) or (b), or 120 days after it reconvenes for a request under both subparagraphs (a) and (b). If the panel determines that the level of benefits the complaining Party proposes to suspend is manifestly excessive, it shall determine the level of benefits it considers to be of equivalent effect. 6. Unless the panel has determined that the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment, the complaining Party may suspend benefits up to the level the panel has determined under paragraph 5 or, if the panel has not determined the level, the level the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 3. If the panel determines that the complaining Party has not followed the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4, the panel shall set out in its determination the extent to which the complaining Party may suspend benefits in which subject matter in order to ensure full compliance with the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4. The complaining Party may suspend benefits only in a manner consistent with the panel's determination. 7. The complaining Party shall not suspend benefits if, within 30 days after it provides written notice of intent to suspend benefits or, if the panel is reconvened under paragraph 5, within 20 days after the panel provides its determination, the responding Party provides written notice to the complaining Party that it will pay a monetary assessment. The disputing Parties shall begin consultations no later than 10 days after the date on which the responding Party has given notice that it intends to pay a monetary assessment, with a view to reaching agreement on the amount of the assessment. If the disputing Parties are unable to reach an agreement within 30 days after consultations begin and are not engaged in discussions regarding the use of a fund under paragraph 8, the amount of the assessment shall be set at a level, in U.S. dollars, equal to 50 per cent of the level of the benefits the panel has determined under paragraph 5 to be of equivalent effect or, if the panel has not determined the level, 50 per cent of the level that the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 3. 8. If a monetary assessment is to be paid to the complaining Party, then it

28-18

shall be paid in U.S. dollars, or in an equivalent amount of the currency of the responding Party or in another currency agreed to by the disputing Parties in equal, quarterly instalments beginning 60 days after the date on which the responding Party gives notice that it intends to pay an assessment. If the circumstances warrant, the disputing Parties may decide that the responding Party shall pay an assessment into a fund designated by the disputing Parties for appropriate initiatives to facilitate trade between the Parties, including by further reducing unreasonable trade barriers or by assisting the responding Party to carry out its obligations under this Agreement. 9. At the same time as the payment of its first quarterly instalment is due, the responding Party shall provide to the complaining Party a plan of the steps it intends to take to eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment. 10. A responding Party may pay a monetary assessment in lieu of suspension of benefits by the complaining Party for a maximum of 12 months from the date on which the responding Party has provided written notice under paragraph 7 unless the complaining Party agrees to an extension. 11. A responding Party that seeks an extension of the period for the payment under paragraph 10 shall make a written request for that extension no later than 30 days before the expiration of the 12 month period. The disputing Parties shall determine the length and terms of any extension, including the amount of the assessment. 12. The complaining Party may suspend the application to the responding Party of benefits in accordance with paragraphs 3, 4 and 6, if: (a) the responding Party fails to make a payment under paragraph 8 or fails to make the payment under paragraph 13 after electing to do so; the responding Party fails to provide the plan as required under paragraph 9; or the monetary assessment period, including any extension, has lapsed and the responding Party has not yet eliminated the nonconformity or the nullification or impairment.

(b)

(c)

13. If the responding Party notified the complaining Party that it wished to discuss the possible use of a fund and the disputing Parties do not agree on the use of a fund within three months of the date of the responding Party's notice under paragraph 7, and this time period has not been extended by agreement of the disputing Parties, the responding Party may elect to make the monetary assessment payment equal to 50 per cent of the amount determined under paragraph 5 or the level proposed by the complaining Party under paragraph 3 if there has been no determination under paragraph 5. If this election is made, the

28-19

payment must be made within nine months of the responding Party's notice under paragraph 7 in U.S. dollars, or in an equivalent amount of the currency of the responding Party or in another currency agreed to by the disputing Parties. If the election is not made, the complaining Party may suspend the application of benefits in the amount determined under paragraph 5, or the level proposed by the complaining Party under paragraph 3 if there has been no determination under paragraph 5, at the end of the election period. 14. The complaining Party shall accord sympathetic consideration to the notice provided by the responding Party regarding the possible use of the fund referred to in paragraphs 8 and 13. 15. Compensation, suspension of benefits and the payment of a monetary assessment shall be temporary measures. None of these measures is preferred to full implementation through elimination of the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment. Compensation, suspension of benefits and the payment of a monetary assessment shall only be applied until the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment, or until a mutually satisfactory solution is reached.

Article 28.21: Compliance Review 1. Without prejudice to the procedures in Article 28.20 (Non-Implementation - Compensation and Suspension of Benefits), if a responding Party considers that it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment found by the panel, it may refer the matter to the panel by providing a written notice to the complaining Party or Parties. The panel shall issue its report on the matter no later than 90 days after the responding Party provides written notice. 2. If the panel determines that the responding Party has eliminated the nonconformity or the nullification or impairment, the complaining Party or Parties shall promptly reinstate any benefits suspended under Article 28.20 (NonImplementation - Compensation and Suspension of Benefits).

Section B: Domestic Proceedings and Private Commercial Dispute Settlement

Article 28.22: Private Rights No Party shall provide for a right of action under its law against any other Party on the ground that a measure of that other Party is inconsistent with its obligations under this Agreement, or that the other Party has otherwise failed to carry out its obligations under this Agreement.

28-20

Article 28.23: Alternative Dispute Resolution 1. Each Party shall, to the maximum extent possible, encourage and facilitate the use of arbitration and other means of alternative dispute resolution for the settlement of international commercial disputes between private parties in the free trade area. 2. To this end, each Party shall provide appropriate procedures to ensure observance of agreements to arbitrate and for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards in such disputes. 3. A Party shall be deemed to be in compliance with paragraph 2 if it is a party to, and is in compliance with, the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards done at New York on 10 June 1958.

an amendment to a non-conforming provision of any existing taxation measure to the extent that the amendment does not decrease its conformity, at the time of the amendment, with any of those Articles; the adoption or enforcement of any new taxation measure aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition or collection of taxes, including any taxation measure that differentiates between persons based on their place of residence for tax purposes, provided that the taxation measure does not arbitrarily discriminate between persons, goods or services of the Parties;10 a provision that conditions the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage relating to the contributions to, or income of, a pension trust, pension plan, superannuation fund or other arrangement to provide pension, superannuation or similar benefits, on a requirement that the Party maintain continuous jurisdiction, regulation or supervision over that trust, plan, fund or other arrangement; or any excise duty on insurance premiums to the extent that such tax would, if levied by the other Parties, be covered by subparagraph (e), (f) or (g).

(j)

7. Subject to paragraph 3, and without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under paragraph 5, Article 9.10.2 (Performance Requirements), Article 9.10.3 and Article 9.10.5 shall apply to taxation measures. 8. Article 9.8 (Expropriation and Compensation) shall apply to taxation measures. However, no investor may invoke Article 9.8 (Expropriation and Compensation) as the basis for a claim if it has been determined pursuant to this paragraph that the measure is not an expropriation. An investor that seeks to invoke Article 9.8 (Expropriation and Compensation) with respect to a taxation measure must first refer to the designated authorities of the Party of the investor and the respondent Party, at the time that it gives its notice of intent under Article 9.19 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration), the issue of whether that taxation measure is not an expropriation. If the designated authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is not an expropriation within a period of six months of the referral, the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under Article 9.19 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration).

10

The Parties understand that this subparagraph must be interpreted by reference to the footnote to Article XIV(d) of GATS as if the Article was not restricted to services or direct taxes.

29-8

9. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Singapore from adopting taxation measures no more trade restrictive than necessary to address Singapore's public policy objectives arising out of its specific constraints of space. Article 29.5: Tobacco Control Measures11 A Party may elect to deny the benefits of Section B of Chapter 9 (Investment) with respect to claims challenging a tobacco control measure12 of the Party. Such a claim shall not be submitted to arbitration under Section B of Chapter 9 (Investment) if a Party has made such an election. If a Party has not elected to deny benefits with respect to such claims by the time of the submission of such a claim to arbitration under Section B of Chapter 9 (Investment), a Party may elect to deny benefits during the proceedings. For greater certainty, if a Party elects to deny benefits with respect to such claims, any such claim shall be dismissed.

Article 29.6: Treaty of Waitangi 1. Provided that such measures are not used as a means of arbitrary or unjustified discrimination against persons of the other Parties or as a disguised restriction on trade in goods, trade in services and investment, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the adoption by New Zealand of measures it deems necessary to accord more favourable treatment to Maori in respect of matters covered by this Agreement, including in fulfilment of its obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi. 2. The Parties agree that the interpretation of the Treaty of Waitangi, including as to the nature of the rights and obligations arising under it, shall not be subject to the dispute settlement provisions of this Agreement. Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) shall otherwise apply to this Article. A panel established under Article 28.7 (Establishment of a Panel) may be requested to determine only whether any measure referred to in paragraph 1 is inconsistent with a Party's rights under this Agreement.

11

For greater certainty, this Article does not prejudice: (i) the operation of Article 9.15 (Denial of Benefits); or (ii) a Party's rights under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) in relation to a tobacco control measure.
12

A tobacco control measure means a measure of a Party related to the production or consumption of manufactured tobacco products (including products made or derived from tobacco), their distribution, labelling, packaging, advertising, marketing, promotion, sale, purchase, or use, as well as enforcement measures, such as inspection, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. For greater certainty, a measure with respect to tobacco leaf that is not in the possession of a manufacturer of tobacco products or that is not part of a manufactured tobacco product is not a tobacco control measure.

29-9

Section B: General Provisions

Article 29.7: Disclosure of Information Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require a Party to furnish or allow access to information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to its law or would impede law enforcement, or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or which would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private.

Article 29.8: Traditional Knowledge and Traditional Cultural Expressions Subject to each Party's international obligations, each Party may establish appropriate measures to respect, preserve and promote traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions.
